# IPFS

- It's a file system with [content based addressing](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5Uj6uR3fp-U).
	- Files are automatically deduplicated. 
- Once something is added, it can't be changed anymore. 
- IPFS supports versioning using commits.
- Keeping files available is a challenge. If the nodes storing a file go down, it'll disappear from the network. Filecoin solves this issue!
