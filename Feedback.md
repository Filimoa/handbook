# Feedback

Feedback is the core of personal and professional growth. Feedback help us being better at what we do establishing clear communications and expectations.

All feedback is good feedback. If you agree with it, it tells you something about yourself which you can to work on correcting. If you don't agree with it, it tells you that there is an incorrect perception about you in the other persons mind. You can also work on correcting that. When someone tells you something is wrong, they're almost always right. When someone tells you how to fix it, they're almost always wrong. Collect feedback from everybody.

## Taking Feedback

- Use the word advice instead of feedback to get more results.
- The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile.
- Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.
- Be mindful. Develop meta-awareness around the areas that you received feedback.
  - Look for opportunities to _stop doing_ or _start doing_ critiqued behaviors.

### Technical Feedback

- You are not your work (code, design, ...).
- No matter how much you know about something, someone else will always know more.
- Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.
- True authority stems from knowledge, not from position.
- Critique code instead of people â€” be kind to the coder, not to the code.
- Focus on [Empathy](http://bravenewgeek.com/engineering-empathy/).

## Giving Feedback

- Feedback needs to be informal, frequent, and done authentically.
- Challenge ideas not people. Address behavior, but don't label people.
- Prepare. What do you value in someone? Where do you think are their biggest opportunities to improve?
- **Keep the feedback actionable, specific, and kind.**
- Imagine what things feel like from the other perspective.
- How to compose a successful critical commentary (_from_ [_Daniel Dennett_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett)):
  - You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, _"Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way"_.
  - You should list any points of agreement (if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
  - You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
  - Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.
