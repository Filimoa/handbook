# Talking

- Smile and look at the eyes.
- Remove filler words.
- Speak with [[Openness | sincerity and passion]].
- Speak [slow](https://sive.rs/slow) and naturally. Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it's an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it's a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.
- Aim to make liberal use of the _you_ pronoun.
- No matter how correct you are, you won't get anywhere by making the other person feel stupid. Not being annoying is more important than being smart. Aim to make friends. [Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).
- Ask for help instead of demanding it.
- Favor interrogative-led questions over leading questions. A leading question attempts to get the [[Listening | listener]] to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where; what; when; why. "Did you like the movie?" vs "What did you think about the movie?".
- Make [interesting questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_iFxFt9lh1i0mxKRIhOSd2e8X1LNvxnihbChKXhyOc/mobilebasic) to know people better. Use FORD (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams) as fallback topics.
- Remember people's names. Humans want to be significant. We strive for meaning.
- Dishonest Flattery while effective in some cases, will destroy you long term. If you are unable to find a compliment about another human being that is truthful, you're not trying hard enough.
	- Your goal is not to do what _you_ think is best, it’s to help _others_. This includes respecting their preferences, and respecting their autonomy. It’s key that you listen to feedback, be open to the possibility that your actions are systematically unhelpful, and work to build better models of your friends and their preferences. In an ideal world I’d only take the actions that are net good, and avoid all of the ones that are net bad, but in a limited information world this is impossible. And empirically, actually trying _far_ outweighs not trying at all. But you still want to get as net good as possible!
