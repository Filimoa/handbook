# Company Handbooks
## Principles

- Keeping a handbook is key for  a good [[Company Knowledge Management]].
- Everyone should contribute to it and each page has a clear owner that aim to keep it consistent with the rest of the handbook.
- Avoid duplicating knowledge.  For each question there is one and only one answer, and a team dedicated to getting owners of various systems to actually codify their knowledge.
- Everything is a WIP. No need to create empty sections or say it'll be updated later.
- Make it *permissionless*. Anyone can edit anything, similar to PRs on GitHub.
- Link everything together to improve discoverability.
- Each kind of document should have an explicit place.
- [[Documentation]] should have a common entry point (index) to increase discoverability. Each team could have their own [[processes]] on top.
- Ask questions in public channels! If someone sends you a handbook link, that means you have the answer documented - they don't mean that you should have found that yourself or that this is the complete answer. If the answer to a question isn't documented, make a pull request to add it to the handbook in a place you have looked for it.
