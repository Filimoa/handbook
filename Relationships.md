# Relationships

- Have fun with the people you love.
- Build small groups. Small communities do more things that larger ones.
- Do novel and exciting things with your friends often.
- Create many contexts. A friend who you see in only one context is likely to be a less close friend than someone who you see in many contexts, and connect with over many different things, rather than a single shared interest.
