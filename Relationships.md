# Relationships

- Have fun with the people you love.
- Build small groups. Small communities do more things that larger ones.
- Do novel and exciting things with your friends often.
- Create many contexts. A friend who you see in only one context is likely to be a less close friend than someone who you see in many contexts, and connect with over many different things, rather than a single shared interest.
- Be the first person toÂ [reach out](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-23-taking-social-initiative). Be the first person to organize events. Be the first person to say hi. Everyone is nice but you have to say hi first.
- Spend more time with fewer people.
