# Relationships

- Have fun with the people you love.
- Build small groups. Small communities do more things that larger ones.
- Do novel and exciting things with your friends often.
- [Friends make life good](https://youtu.be/I9hJ_Rux9y0). They provide the scaffolding that makes it not just bearable but fun. They give us a sense of meaning and purpose and are a source of security, self esteem and happiness. Almost nothing predicts how happy you will be as how connected you feel and a lack of social connection is associated with a number of diseases and a shorter life.
- Create many contexts. A friend who you see in only one context is likely to be a less close friend than someone who you see in many contexts, and connect with over many different things, rather than a single shared interest.
- Be the first person toÂ [reach out](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/mini-blog-post-23-taking-social-initiative). Be the first person to organize events. Be the first person to say hi. Everyone is nice but you have to say hi first.
- Spend more time with fewer people.
