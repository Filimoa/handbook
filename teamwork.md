# Teamwork

- Share a vision to make [loosely coupled, tightly aligned teams][spotify-culture].
- When coming up with a long-term technical vision is important to stay abstract.
  - Stick to defining components and keep concepts. Show how the components interact.
  - Define boundaries and limitations of each component.
  - Write tech specs before you write software (examples in [Codeburst][codeburst] and [Lyft][lift])
- Define the culture and values. [Culture][culture] is simply a shared way of doing something with passion.
- Work in the open and document everything.
  - Processes
  - Conventions
  - Meetings
  - Responsibilities
- You can create a Handbook to put everything together. Everyone should contribute to it and each page has a clear owner that aim to keep it consistent with the rest of the Handbook.
- Keep a source of truth and keep it up to date. When something is not relevant anymore, deprecate or delete it. All the documents should evolve.
- Aim to be a completely autonomous team. You build it, you run it!
- Someone should be the information hub. It helps connecting the dots that wouldn’t otherwise get connected.
- Write postmortems after large incidents. This will create a feedback loop to guide learning about what happened and how it can be avoided next time.
- Don't focus on a particular solution to a problem, instead, describe the problem itself. Always provide the full context of what you’re trying to do when requesting help.
- How to drive change: find people who agree on the problem, start small, experiment, scale, repeat.
- Every business has an equation that describes how it generates revenue. Write it down and decompose it to better understand the relationships.
- Strive for constructive conflict. Get people to ask questions. Engage in passionate, unfiltered debate about what you need to do to succeed.
- Encourage to fail. Failing is good if the team learn from it!
- Push relentlessly toward automation.

## Communication

- Use [common techniques](../communications) and always be friendly.
- Prefer asynchronous communications.
- Have a primary communication channel.
- Agree on the terminology. Similar understanding of terms makes discussion more productive.
- Work through confrontations mindfully:
  - Acknowledge the positive intentions. Try to understanding his or her rationale and state it out loud directly to them.
  - Express what you see!
  - Identify and propose a solution. You should try to build consensus by demonstrating how your solution will resolve everyone’s concerns, not just your own.
  - Outline the benefits and advantages of your proposal.
  - Understanding. Either nail down agreement on a next action or step, or work together to develop alternatives
