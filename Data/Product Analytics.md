# Product Analytics

Product analytics can be defined as the way companies analyze what their users are doing in their product.

- [[Organizations]] want **visibility** into how their users use their products to make educated decisions on what they should be **improving and building**.
- SQL is not the ideal tool for analyzing event data. Explorations into why users are doing a particular action requires **diving into the granular events themselves**.
- Measure tracking quality and treat all tracking bugs as production incidents.
- Product Analytics is hard because when you instrument the events you don’t know what you want to analyze. When you analyze them you often didn’t capture what you want to measure.
