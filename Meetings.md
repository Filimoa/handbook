# Meetings

- [Meetings should be as short, focused, and small as possible](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/01/the-low-information-diet/comment-page-5/).

## Update Meetings

- Plans: What tasks am I doing next week?
- Problems: what is blocking progress?
- Other: what else should the team know?

## Decision Meetings
