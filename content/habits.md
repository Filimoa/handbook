# Habits

[We, humans, are basically habit machines](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1059504529111158784). We form habits. We run on those habits all day long. Habits can be great because they help us get tasks done efficiently without having to spend willpower on them all the time. Habits will keep the frontal cortex free to solve other problems. They can also cause addictions and be harmful for us. It’s important to be aware of your habits and know how to break habits and know how to make habits. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Remember, you’re not your habits! Life is just a series of these steps that push you forward, little by little, but it [compounds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp). And remember, there are [no hacks](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/useful-hacks/) in life!

These steps might be helpful when building habits:

* **Build a routine**. Set a specific, repeating time when you will do the thing in your calendar. Keep that slot clear, always. Never let something interrupt this task. Shape the environment to support your routine. Make it easy to start and make it hard to not do it.

* **Learn to say no**. If someone wants you to do something else during this time slot, say no, and tell them why.
* **Never break the routine**. Breaking it once makes it much easier to break the next scheduled time. Instead think about the smallest thing you can perform and make it your goal for the day. If you do break it, feel bad about it and get back on the horse as fast as you can.
* **Use the power of accountability to reinforce the routine**. If you can find someone who will hold you accountable, do it. Someone who does the routine with you, or a coach who will call you out if you make excuses.
* **One thing at a time**. Don't build a big routine of 15 tasks at once. Ease into it one habit at a time. Changing one at a time routine allows you to isolate the beneficts. Remove related bad habits at the same time.
* **Don't overload yourself**. Leave time in your schedule for play. If it gets to be too much, decide which one you will drop permanently to make rooms for the rest.
