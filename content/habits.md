# Habits

[We, humans, are basically habit machines](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1059504529111158784). We form habits. We run on those habits all day long. Habits can be great because they help us get tasks done efficiently without having to spend willpower on them all the time. The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it ([ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion)). Habits will keep the frontal cortex free to solve other problems. They can also cause addictions and be harmful for us. It's important to be aware of your habits and know how to break habits and know how to make habits. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Remember, you're not your habits! Life is just a series of these steps that push you forward, little by little, but it [compounds](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp). And remember, there are [no hacks](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/useful-hacks/) in life!

These steps might be helpful when building habits:

- **Build a routine**. Set a specific, repeating time when you will do the thing in your calendar. Keep that slot clear, always. Never let something interrupt this task. Shape the environment to support your routine and habits. Make it easy to start and make it hard or impossible to not do it. Replace self-control with planning and proper environment (uninstalling a game makes removes a future decission to play it).

- **Learn to say no**. If someone wants you to do something else during this time slot, say no, and tell them why.
- **Never break the routine**. Breaking it once makes it much easier to break the next scheduled time. Instead think about the smallest thing you can perform and make it your goal for the day. If you do break it, feel bad about it and get back on the horse as fast as you can.
- **Use the power of accountability to reinforce the routine**. If you can find someone who will hold you accountable, do it. Someone who does the routine with you, or a coach who will call you out if you make excuses.
- **One thing at a time**. Don't build a big routine of 15 tasks at once. Ease into it one habit at a time. Changing one at a time routine allows you to isolate the beneficts. Remove related bad habits at the same time.
- **Don't overload yourself**. Leave time in your schedule for play. If it gets to be too much, decide which one you will drop permanently to make rooms for the rest.

Cognitive inertia is the reason that changing our habits can be difficult. The default is always the path of least resistance, which is easy to accept and harder to question. The important thing about inertia is that it is only the initial push that is difficult. After that, progress tends to be smoother.

Use forcing functions to your advantage. A forcing function is any task, activity or event that forces you to take action and produce a result.

Turn vague goals into trigger-action plans (TAPs). If X then Y. That works because they help us notice situations where we could carry out our intentions. They force us to turn vague and ambiguous goals into more specific ones. A good TAP fulfills three requirements:

- The trigger is clear. The "when" part is a specific, visible thing that's easy to notice.
- The trigger is consistent. The action is something that you'll always want to do when the trigger is fulfilled.
- The TAP furthers your goals.

## Themes

To better accomplish positive life change, [give yourself a theme](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE). A theme will be easy to follow and will impact your daily actions. Resolutions give us the feeling of failure, themes gives us chances to apply them. A good theme can't fail. Just having a theme in your mind will change the way you think. You'll notice paths that weren't there before. Broad themes gives flexibility. Pick a broad directional idea that resonates with you and run with it. Themes can be as long or short as you need. These are some theme ideas:

- Order
- Simplicity
- Novelty
- Experiments
- Joy
- Health
- Finances
- Discipline
- Growth
- People
- Knowledge
- Nature
- Reflection
- Iteration
