# Habits

[We, humans, are basically habit machines](https://twitter.com/JamesClear/status/1059504529111158784). We form habits. We run on those habits all day long. Your outcomes are a lagging measure of your habits. How you spend your days is how you spend your life. Every action you take is a vote for the type of person you wish to become.

Habits can be great because they help us get tasks done efficiently without having to spend willpower (a limited resource) on them all the time. The purpose of a habit is to remove that action from self-negotiation. You no longer expend energy deciding whether to do it ([ego depletion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ego_depletion)). Habits will keep the frontal cortex free to solve other problems.

[Make part of your identity to be an agent](https://www.neelnanda.io/blog/become-a-person-who-actually-does-things) that does things. E.g: noticing the small problems, and fixing them. The most effective way to change your habits is to focus not on what you want to achieve, but on who you wish to become.

They can also cause addictions and be harmful for us. It's important to be aware of your habits and know how to break habits and know how to make habits. Habits are the compound interest of self-improvement. Make small habits that push you forward, little by little, and make them [compound](https://www.investopedia.com/terms/c/compoundinterest.asp). Remember, there are [no hacks](http://www.collaborativefund.com/blog/useful-hacks/) in life!

Helpful steps for building habits:

- **Build a routine**. Set a specific, repeating time when you will do the thing in your calendar. Keep that slot clear, always. Never let something interrupt this task. Shape the environment to support your routine and habits. Make it easy to start and make it hard or impossible to not do it. Replace self-control with planning and proper environment (uninstalling a game makes removes a future decision to play it). You can also **stack habits**. Connect the habit that doesn't appear that much to you to what you strongly like. Then you'll be doing it for what you like.

- **Learn to say no**. If someone wants you to do something else during this time slot, say no, and tell them why.
- **Never break the routine**. Breaking it once makes it much easier to break the next scheduled time. Instead think about the smallest thing you can perform and make it your goal for the day. If you do break it, feel bad about it and get back on the horse as fast as you can. Use forcing functions to your advantage. A forcing function is any task, activity or event that forces you to take action and produce a result. Have a bias toward taking action. No lazy deferring. When it's habit time, it should require more willpower to break the habit than to keep going. [Become a mindless robot and don't think twice](https://tiffanymatthe.com/not-thinking).
  - Make the decision in advance. E.g. the two-minute rule. Where you decide that for anything that takes less than two minutes, you do it. No thinking, no arguing, just swift action. Another method is planning out your days in advance. Then when the time comes, you can mindlessly follow the schedule you have made for yourself.
  - Be proactively lazy by organizing a space for its intended purpose. That way you are priming it to make the next action easy.
- **Use the power of accountability to reinforce the routine**. If you can find someone who will hold you accountable, do it. Someone who does the routine with you, or a coach who will call you out if you make excuses. Whatever you value, hang around people that are better at it than you are.
- **One thing at a time**. Don't build a big routine of 15 tasks at once. Ease into it one habit at a time. Changing one at a time routine allows you to isolate the benefits. Remove related bad habits at the same time.
- **Don't overload yourself**. Leave time in your schedule for play. If it gets to be too much, decide which one you will drop permanently to make rooms for the rest.

Cognitive inertia is the reason that changing our habits can be difficult. The default is always the path of least resistance, which is easy to accept and harder to question. The important thing about inertia is that it is only the initial push that is difficult. After that, progress tends to be smoother. A good life is a series of good days!

### TAPs

Turn vague goals into trigger-action plans (TAPs). **If X then Y**. That works because they help us notice situations where we could carry out our intentions. They force us to turn vague and ambiguous goals into more specific ones. A good TAP fulfills three requirements:

- **The trigger is clear**. The _when_ part is a specific, visible thing that's easy to notice.
- **The trigger is consistent**. The action is something that you'll always want to do when the trigger is fulfilled.
- **The TAP furthers your goals**.

### Systems vs Goals

Goals are good for setting a direction. Systems are for making progress. You do not rise to the level of your goals. You fall to the level of your systems. Build systems to take the right actions effortlessly Systemisation is a mindset, not an algorithm. It's the perspective of looking at your life, noticing the parts that are inefficient, or require willpower, or just never get done. There are some underlying points to always bear in mind with systems:

- Minimise decision points. TRhe main thing that consumes willpower isn't the process of doing a task, it's deciding to do the task in the first place. The goal is to get stuff done, not to decide to get stuff done.
- Shape the default. The ideal situation is for doing the right action to feel like the default.
- Beware trivial inconveniences. Think of decisions in terms of activation energy. Some decisions need more energy than others depending on how are setup. Make the good decision effortless. Remove friction from the path to your goals.

### [The Four Laws of Behavior Change](https://www.amazon.com/Atomic-Habits-Proven-Build-Break/dp/0735211299/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=atomic+habits&qid=1616005357&sr=8-1)

- Any habit can be broken down into a feedback loop that involves four steps: cue, craving, response, and reward.
- The ultimate purpose of habits is to solve the problems of life with as little energy and effort as possible. Once our habits become automatic, we stop paying attention to what we are doing.
- These are a simple set of rules we can use to build better habits.
  1. Make it obvious.
     - Identify a current habit you already do each day and then stack your new behavior on top.
     - Every habit is initiated by a cue. We are more likely to notice cues that stand out.
     - Make the cues of good habits obvious in your environment.
     - Eliminate a bad habit reducing exposure to the cues that causes it.
  2. Make it attractive.
     - Temptation bundling: Take a behavior that you think of as important but unappealing and link it to a behavior that you're drawn to.
     - Habits are a dopamine-driven feedback loop. When dopamine rises, so does our motivation to act.
     - The culture we live in determines which behaviors are attractive to us. We tend to imitate the habits of three social groups: the close (family and friends), the many (the tribe), and the powerful (those with status and prestige).
  3. Make it easy.
     - Human behavior follows the Law of Least Effort. We will naturally gravitate toward the option that requires the least amount of work.
     - Create an environment where doing the right thing is as easy as possible.
     - Prime your environment to make future good habits easier and to increase friction for bad habits.
  4. Make it satisfying.
     - Attach some immediate gratification to your habits that reinforce your desired identity.
     - The human brain evolved to prioritize immediate rewards over delayed rewards.

## Themes

To better accomplish positive life change, [give yourself a theme](https://youtu.be/NVGuFdX5guE). A theme will be easy to follow and will impact your daily actions. Without knowing where you want to go you just wonder. Resolutions give us the feeling of failure, themes gives us chances to apply them. A good theme can't fail. Just having a theme in your mind will change the way you think. You'll notice paths that weren't there before. Broad themes gives flexibility. Pick a broad directional idea that resonates with you and run with it. Themes can be as long or short as you need. These are some theme ideas:

- Order
- Simplicity
- Novelty
- Experiments
- Joy
- Health
- Finances
- Discipline
- Growth
- People
- Knowledge
- Nature
- Reflection
- Iteration
- Attention

## Routine

A way to keep yourself on track with your habits is to have a morning routine.

1. Rules. Remind yourself on the current set of rules, constrains, various addictions, time-draining things. E.g. limit social media, do some stretching, ...
2. Gratitude. Visualize and meditate on the idea that you might die today.
3. Long-term goals and short-term goals. Review big goals that you would like to achieve in the next years and the short term goals that lead to them that you can act on.
4. Visualize the day. Visualize yourself going through the day challenges and wins.
5. Review your core [values](values.md).
