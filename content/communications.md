# Comunications

> To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others — Tony Robbins

Communication is the science of transmitting knowledge to other humans. It goes by many names: debate, negotiation, discussion, education, and many more. Communication is a skill that is learnable.

## Talking

* Become genuinely interested in other people.
* Smile and look at the eyes.
* Hold solid eye contact with everyone as much as possible.
* Speak with sincerity and passion.
* Encourage others to talk about themselves.
* Speak slow and naturally.
* Remove filler words.
* Learn to listen. Listening is difficult because it involves suppressing your ego long enough to consider what is being said before you respond. Forget your agenda. Don't have internal monologue.
  * Avoid trying to respond immediately and allow the other person time to finish speaking.
  * Don't answer your phone while speaking with someone in real life. If the real life conversation starts, has precedence over the asynchronous ones.
* Aim to make liberal use of the _you_ pronoun.

## Writting

* Try to use the active voice whenever possible.
* Keep in mind your style:
  * **Be concise**. Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.
  * **Be Useful**. Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
  * **Be specific**. Avoid vague language. Cut the fluff. Delete unnecessary words.
  * **Be consistent**.
  * **Add rythm**. Vary the sentence lenght to break the monotony.
* [Style is a small part of writing well. Most of writing is thinking clearly.](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro)
* Have solid Schemas. This allows you to remove the clutter and avoid confusion:
  * Define a clear thesis.
  * Support your thesis with arguments.
  * Declare and reject the antithesis.
  * Conclusions.
* Human beings are wired to respond to storytelling. A story arc is a way to structure ideas to tap into this response, typically by describing a change in the world.
* Use positive language rather than negative language.
* Write in a conversational tone.
* Use second-person and describe actions to a user. Technical content talks to users when support agents can’t.
* Divide things into small chunks.
* If you have multiple points in a text, number them to make replies easier.
* Don't fully think through your ideas before writing. It's inefficient. The best way to think is by writing. It compels your brain to connect the dots.

### Blogging

* Writing is Thinking. Writing things down helps clarifying ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. [Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html).
* Expect 80% of the ideas in an post to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong.
* To decide if your idea is worth writing about, [ask these questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/):
  * Would this have helped me a year ago?
  * Would this have helped me last week?
  * Do you think this would be interesting to at least like 2 other people?
* [You are best positioned to help people one step behind you](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you’re writing about.
* [Share unoriginal ideas](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/). Your own ideas mostly seem trivial to you because you have the right concept structures in place to support them. You wouldn’t come up with these ideas otherwise.
* Start with Why. Start with a question. Write the first flawed answer that comes to mind. Write the first question or objection that comes to mind from that answer. Write the first response that comes to mind from that, ...
