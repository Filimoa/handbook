## Talking

- Become genuinely interested in other people.
- Smile and look at the eyes.
- Hold solid eye contact with everyone as much as possible.
- Speak with sincerity and passion.
- Encourage others to talk about themselves.
- Speak slow and naturally.
- Remove filler words.
- Learn to listen. Listening is difficult because it involves suppressing your ego long enough to consider what is being said before you respond. Forget your agenda.
  - Avoid trying to respond immediately and allow the other person time to finish speaking.
- Aim to make liberal use of the _you_ pronoun.

## Writting

- Try to use the active voice whenever possible.
- Keep in mind your style:
  - **Be concise**. Understand the topic you’re writing about. Use simple words and sentences.
  - **Be Useful**. Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
  - **Be specific**. Avoid vague language. Cut the fluff.
  - **Be consistent**.
- Have solid Schemas. This allows you to remove the clutter and avoid confusion:
  - Define a clear thesis.
  - Support your thesis with arguments.
  - Declare and reject the antithesis.
  - Conclusions.
- Human beings are wired to respond to storytelling. A story arc is a way to structure ideas to tap into this response, typically by describing a change in the world.
- Use positive language rather than negative language.
- Use second-person and describe actions to a user. Technical content talks to users when support agents can’t.
- If you have multiple points in a text, number them to make replies easier.
