# Ideas

A few random ideas that crossed my mind in the past.

## Awesome Game

- Modular Approach. The idea is to have a main character and multiple shards to play. Each shard could implement a different ruleset or genre.
- Player Driven Economy. Everything is made by players and traded for real life currency. The developers only get a fee for each trade. This makes the game fully F2P but also supports the developers.
- Companion Apps. Some tasks like trading or planning could be done from a mobile device.
- Systems (items, skills, monsters, ...) could be affected by evolutionary processes.
  - Merging two skills could produce a new one (inheriting properties and perhaps with a small mutation)
  - Monsters will develop resistance agains what's killing them.
  - Quests rewards will also change dynamically.
