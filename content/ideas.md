## Awesome Game

- Modular Approach. The idea is to have a main character and multiple shards to play. Each shard could implement a different ruleset or genre.
- The modularity could also be implemented in the graphic side. You can choose the graphics pack you like just like another cosmetic.
- Player Driven Economy. Everything is made by players and traded for real life currency. The developers only get a fee for each trade. This makes the game fully F2P but also supports the developers.
- Companion Apps. Some tasks like trading or planning could be done from a mobile device.
- Systems \(items, skills, monsters, ...\) could be affected by evolutionary processes.
  - Merging two skills could produce a new one \(inheriting properties and perhaps with a small mutation\)
  - Monsters will develop resistance agains what's killing them.
  - Quests rewards will also change dynamically.
- Players can vote for the next patch changes with ingame money. This way developers gets feedback on what's important.

## Unconventional Changelogs

- What if each city or town had a changelog? What changed in the last _release_? Did it change a street direction or opened a new commerce?
- What if stores had a changelog? That'd mean price history for each product and also new products woulf be easier to find.

## Fake Currencies

- A chores app where kids could earn a currency. This could be traded for rewards like going to the cinema or getting a new PC game.

## Data as a Service

- Startup that gathers and organize datasets on demand. Over time they'll have lots of categorized and linked data that might be useful for other companies.
- The data could be exposed through a database and the startup could make money selling access to it.
