# Ideas

A few random ideas that crossed my mind in the past.

## Awesome Game

- Modular Approach. The idea is to have a main character and multiple shards to play. Each shard could implement a different ruleset or genre.
- Player Driven Economy. Everything is made by players and traded for real life currency. The developers only get a fee for each trade. This makes the game fully F2P but also supports the developers.
- Companion Apps. Some tasks like trading or planning could be done from a mobile device.
- Systems (items, skills, professions) could be affected by evolutionary processes. Merging two skills could produce a new one (inheriting properties and perhaps with a small mutation). Eventually, the systems will be evolved by natural selection! I'm not sure how this feature might affect the game though. It could make it really unbalanced. Perhaps the ratio of mutation could be based on the ratio of usage. Less used skills mutate faster.
