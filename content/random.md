Random thoughts about specific topics. Probably biased based on my experience. As with the rest of the handbook, think of them as a work in progress.

## Politics

- To debate politics as in any other field, first gather information and then decide. [Think like a scientist](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html).
- Think of it as a complex system. Everything is related and has unexpected consequences.
- Don’t attach to any movement so it doesn’t become part of your identity. Arguments are soldiers. Once you attach to one side, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side.
- Political ideologies are mostly wrong. For most issues it's makes a lot more sense to study the issue in detail than try to have an opinion based on precached ideology. It’s just better to discuss issues without invoking teams.
- Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others — Winston Churchill [_probably quoting someone else_](https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government).
- If you think politics is annoying, then it's because you're privileged enough for it to not matter.
- Don't forget two things: your perception of reality has probably been at least a little manipulated, and your opponents are behaving the way they are based on a perception of reality that’s different from your own.
  - What does this look/feel like to the people I don't know?

### [Voting Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D6trAzh6DApKPhbv4/a-voting-theory-primer-for-rationalists)

- [No silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem).
- [Politics In The Animal Kingdom](http://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/) is a great summary of a few methods.
- There are [better ways to build a ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/).
- Approval voting is usually a good choice. Is simple to explain and to count, and comprehensibility is an important factor when choosing a voting method. That said, there are [really good alternatives](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic/).

## Reducing Environmental Impact

- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. In that order.
- Eat local to reduce costs of transportation.
- Invest in new tech. Tech will be able to create new solutions (and new problems too).
- Use renewable energy. Donate to renewable energies projects.
- Insulate your house.
- [Use GMOs](https://www.bio.org/blogs/gmos-have-benefits-environment).
- Vote with your wallet by buy environmentally conscious things from environmentally conscious and if possible, local companies.
- Opt for long lasting products over ones you will have to replace quickly.
- Avoid plastic products.
- Plant plants and create gardens! Donate to organizations that save (better than planting new) trees.
- Reduce meat consumption.
- Donate to birth control projects.
- Systemic problems need systemic solutions. We can't get there if everyone thinks they already "did their part" (turning off light switches, turning the thermostat down a degree, paper/metal straws, sorting recycling).
  - [Individual actions aren't enought to improve the current state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYLWZPFEWTw).
  - [By focussing on the individuals, we miss the much bigger problem of climate change.](https://youtu.be/RSgXcFdHxFI?list=WL). Around 70% of emissions come for 100 companies. Push governments to transform the economy so individuals don't have all the pressure.

## Annual Review List

- [Egoistic Altruism](https://youtu.be/rvskMHn0sqQ): A Selfish Argument for Making the World a Better Place.
- [Optimistic Nihilism](https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14): A great philosophy.
- [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html): You have limited time, and you should spend it wisely in things and with people you care about.
- [The Sagan Series](http://www.saganseries.com/): Breath-taking cinematography and a mesmerising soundtrack lend a powerful scenery to Sagan's narration from his hit TV series, Cosmos.

## Journaling

- Journaling is a "keystone" habit. It tightly locks all of your other habits in place.
- When you are in an intensely emotional mood, journaling can help you more fully experience and understand those emotions.
- Journal about things, people, or situations for which you are grateful. Consider including negative situations like avoiding an accident, for instance.
- The development of a coherent narrative helps you reorganise and structure old memories, making them less traumatic.
- Writing on a regular basis may allow for repeated exposure to your old memories, which will help you get rid of your negative emotional responses.
- Premeditatio malorum. By imagining the worst case scenario ahead of time, you could overcome the fear of negative experiences and make better plans to prevent them.
- [Journaling is a tool you can use to better manage your mental health](https://nesslabs.com/dear-diary).
- There are many methods. Start with a simple one like "What worked, what didn’t, what’s next".

## DNA Genetic Testing and Analysis

- Companies like 23andMe look only at a few specific genomic coordinates that are known to be contain pathogenic variants, but chances are if you have the associated disease you don't have a variant at one of those few select locations. Because of this, [a negative test result does not mean someone isn't at risk for the condition](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/01/opinion/23andme-cancer-dna-test-brca.html).
- If it says I don’t have something, then that means nothing. If it says I do have something, then that means I should be on the lookout for other corroborating data or symptoms.
- You can retrieve information about your DNA variations at [Promethease](https://promethease.com/). Other kind of data can be extracted with [dna.land](https://dna.land/) and [FoundMyMitness Genetics](https://www.foundmyfitness.com/genetics).
- Genetic data may help people today, but it can also be sold to insurance companies.
- How valuable it would be giving your DNA to a competent advertising company? They could be able to profile and predict users with significantly higher personal accuracy.
  - This is analogous to the 1800s when people disagreed over whether one should let a camera take your photo. Ff sequencing prices and mobility continue to advance at current rates, in 30 years your DNA could be sequenced thousands of times a day, everywhere you go in public (the same way you're recorded with security cameras).

## [Principles of Game Design](https://youtu.be/zaxAdRlyZQ8)

1. Create concrete,achievable, and rewarding goals.
1. Design for nuanced emotion.
1. Create rapid and robust controls.
1. Make fun toys, and combine them into games.
1. Make the next action obvious.
1. Give clear and inmmediate feedback with no distraction.
1. Balance skills with challenge.

## [How To Do Hard Things](https://www.drmaciver.com/2019/05/how-to-do-hard-things/)

It’s a useful conceptual framework for how to get better at things that you currently find difficult.

- The Single-Loop System. Useful when you know what success looks like but cannot currently achieve it.
  1. Find something that is _like_ the hard thing but is easy.
  1. Modify the easy thing so that it is like the hard thing in exactly one way that you find hard.
  1. Do the modified thing until it is no longer hard.
  1. If you get stuck, do one of the following:
    a. Go back to step 3 and pick a different way in which the problem is hard.
    b. Recursively apply the general system for learning to do hard things to the thing you’re stuck on.
    c. Go ask an expert or a rubber duck for advice.
    d. If you’re still stuck after trying the first three, it’s possible that you may have hit some sort of natural difficulty limit and may not be able to make progress.
  1. If the original hard thing is now easy, you’re done. If not, go back to step 2.
- The Double-Loop System. When you don’t know what success looks like.
  1. Apply the single loop system to the problem of improving your understanding of the problem space (e.g. consume lots of examples and learn to distinguish good from bad) in order to acquire a sense of good taste.
  1. Apply the single loop system to the problem of doing well according to your own sense of good taste.
  1. Get feedback on the result from others. Do they think you did it well? If yes, great! You’re good at the thing. If no, either improve your sense of taste or theirs. If you choose yours, go back to step 1 with the new example. If you choose theirs, apply the single loop system to the hard problem of convincing others that your thing is good.

## [Signaling](https://julian.digital/2020/03/28/signaling-as-a-service/)

- Most of our everyday actions can be traced back to some form of signaling or status seeking
  - A classic example of this would be a luxury watch: A Rolex isn’t better at telling the time than a cheap Casio – but a Rolex signals something about its owner’s economic power and thus their social standing.
- Our brains deliberately hide this fact from us and others (self deception).
- Signaling can be broken down into different components:
  - Signal Message: This is whatever (hidden) subtext you are trying to convey.
  - Signal Distribution: The method of distributing the signal message.
  - Signal Amplification: How do you make sure your message stand out?
- Software perfectly complements physical goods by distributing their signal messages at scale. Maximizing scale, however, prevents it from monetizing said distribution. This is why social media services are free to use. The added signaling value is solely captured by the physical products that are being shared.

## Social Media

- Internet algorithms are profit-maximizing mechanisms that want to spoon feed me whatever I’m most likely to click on. This is a win-win, symbiotic relationship—until it’s not. When the algorythm is luring in your primitive mind against you, the relationship is parasitic. [The algorythm will learn to show thing that will further confirm and strengthen your existing viewpoints](https://www.ted.com/talks/eli_pariser_beware_online_filter_bubbles).
- Most of our newsfeeds are insular networks made up of people who get their info from the same filter bubble we do.
- Social media provides an unfortunate filter: it dumbs down complex information. [Ideas don’t pass perfectly from one person to another. Like a game of Telephone, the message gets mutated with each re-telling so, over time, ideas "evolve" to be more catchy, copy-able, contagious.](https://ncase.me/crowds/)
- Your information diet is nearly as important as your food diet. We are what we consume.

## News

- Portraying [a society where everyone hates each other](https://ncase.itch.io/wbwwb) is the most dangerous virus of all, because it becomes a self-fulfilling prophecy. Nothing spreads faster than anger. Especially anger in the specific format, ["Just look at how awful the people we hate are"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rE3j_RHkqJc).
- If our perceptions of reality are increasingly informed by media with other-than-truth motivations, we’ll increasingly lose our handle on the truth.
- We’re losing our ability to think together. Communities can only think when people talk and when they’re free to say what they really think. As echo chambers grow larger and more intimidating, people inside them are afraid to defy the sacred narrative. And the more all-encompassing political identities become, the more topics turn from kickable machines to precious infants. Meanwhile, intergroup communication suffers even more, as opposing groups become totally unable to collaborate on ideas.
- A polarized country that isn’t capable of building broad coalitions can’t take forward steps—it can only self-inflict.
- The news also bias the layperson’s perception of risk. The very fact that bad events are rare these days, makes them newsworthy. With a large sample size, unusual tragedies happen daily, and they end up on the news nightly. For example, car crashed might cause more damage than other events like floodings or fires.
  - News are incentivized to cherry-pick stories that spread fast. For example, scam news. A scam is like a virus that converts trust into cynicism, but it’s the news, in the name of keeping things entertaining and addictive, that distributes the virus across the whole country.
- [News programs are, with the exception of a few non-profit or publicly funded ones, commercial enterprises designed to turn and maximize profit](https://www.mrmoneymustache.com/2013/10/01/the-low-information-diet/).
  - The profit comes from advertising, and advertising revenue is maximized by pulling the largest audience, holding their attention for the longest possible time, and putting them into the mental state most conducive to purchasing the products of the advertisers (which turns out to be helplessness and vulnerability). This is why the news always starts out with a sensationalist take on a topic of at least plausible national interest, takes a detour into truly horrific and depressing irrelevant tragedies is one that unfortunately crossed my screen when doing research for this article), then ends on an uplifting note with something like a defiant entrepreneur or a caring soup kitchen. An emotional roller-coaster ride every day of the week. They don't explore solutions.
- [There isn’t enough actual news (ie events that are "new") to fill the standard news slot — so the fillers became pundits and commentators interpreting "news" and "potential news" for us](https://jjbeshara.com/2018/11/20/the-information-pathology-2/). Humans are good at finding efficiencies, and potential events far outweigh the number of past events, and potential negative events captivate our attention better than potential positive events, so these news-cycles naturally became dominated by commentators interpreting any number of potential negative events.
- By excesses to which our hardwired biology and preternatural tendencies have led us over billions of years of evolution. Today these have culminated today in an excess of easy-to-access information that will have as drastic an effect on health in the 21st century that excess food has had in the 20th century.
  - Unhealthy food costs something financially. Consuming seven hours of pointless information is a lot easier and cheaper than eating thirty Twinkies.

## COVID-19

- [Flatten The Curve](https://www.flattenthecurve.com/)
- As someone said, social distancing measures to work must be done when it seems to be overreacting. And if they work, it will seem as if we overreacted.

## Investing

- Today's savings buy tomorrow's liberty. Think long term.
- Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.

## Thought Experiments

A thought experiment is a device with which one performs an intentional, structured process of intellectual deliberation in order to speculate, within a specifiable problem domain, about potential consequents (or antecedents) for a designated antecedent (or consequent). A few interesting ones:

- [Experience Machine](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Experience_machine).

## House Buying

- Be clear about why you're buying a home. Every large decision you have to make about home ownership should somewhat tie in to this.
- Look at houses based on the life style you have not the life style you aspire to have.
- Research nearby future facilities. Schools, shopping malls, coffe shops, transportation, ...
- Treat it as an asset. Think for how much it'll sell.
