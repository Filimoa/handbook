Random thoughts about specific topics. Probably biased based on my experience. As with the rest of the handbook, think of them as a work in progress.

## Politics

- To debate politics as in any other field, first gather information and then decide. [Think like a scientist](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html).
- Think of it as a complex system. Everything is related and has unexpected consequences.
- Don’t attach to any movement so it doesn’t become part of your identity. Arguments are soldiers. Once you attach to one side, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side.
- It’s just better to discuss issues without invoking teams.
- Political ideologies are mostly wrong. For most issues it's makes a lot more sense to study the issue in detail than try to have an opinion based on precached ideology.
- Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others — Winston Churchill [_probably quoting someone else_](https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government).

### Voting Methods

- [No silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem).
- [Politics In The Animal Kingdom](http://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/) is a great summary of a few methods.

## Reducing Environmental Impact

- Donating to birth control projects.
- Eating local to reduce costs of transportation.
- Investing in new tech. Tech will be able to create new solutions (and new problems too).
- Insulate your house.
- Donate to renewable energies projects.
- Use GMOs.
- Vote with your wallet by buying environmentally conscious things from environmentally conscious and if possible, local companies.
- Opt for long lasting products over ones you will have to replace quickly.
- Avoid plastic products.
- Plant plants and create gardens! Donate to organizations that plant trees.
