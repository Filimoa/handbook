Random thoughts about specific topics. Probably biased based on my experience. As with the rest of the handbook, think of them as a work in progress.

## Politics

- To debate politics as in any other field, first gather information and then decide. [Think like a scientist](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html).
- Think of it as a complex system. Everything is related and has unexpected consequences.
- Don’t attach to any movement so it doesn’t become part of your identity. Arguments are soldiers. Once you attach to one side, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side.
- It’s just better to discuss issues without invoking teams.
- Political ideologies are mostly wrong. For most issues it's makes a lot more sense to study the issue in detail than try to have an opinion based on precached ideology.
- Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others — Winston Churchill [_probably quoting someone else_](https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government).
- If you think politics is annoying, then it's because you're privileged enough for it to not matter.

### [Voting Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D6trAzh6DApKPhbv4/a-voting-theory-primer-for-rationalists)

- [No silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem).
- [Politics In The Animal Kingdom](http://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/) is a great summary of a few methods.
- There are [better ways to build a ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/).
- Approval voting is usually a good choice. Is simple to explain and to count, and comprehensibility is an important factor when choosing a voting method. That said, there are [really good alternatives](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic/).

## Reducing Environmental Impact

- Reduce, Reuse, Recycle. In that order.
- Eat local to reduce costs of transportation.
- Invest in new tech. Tech will be able to create new solutions (and new problems too).
- Use renewable energy. Donate to renewable energies projects.
- Insulate your house.
- [Use GMOs](https://www.bio.org/blogs/gmos-have-benefits-environment).
- Vote with your wallet by buy environmentally conscious things from environmentally conscious and if possible, local companies.
- Opt for long lasting products over ones you will have to replace quickly.
- Avoid plastic products.
- Plant plants and create gardens! Donate to organizations that save (better than planting new) trees.
- Reduce meat consumption.
- Donate to birth control projects.
- Systemic problems need systemic solutions. We can't get there if everyone thinks they already "did their part" (turning off light switches, turning the thermostat down a degree, paper/metal straws, sorting recycling).
  - [Individual actions aren't enought to improve the current state](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DYLWZPFEWTw).
  - [By focussing on the individuals, we miss the much bigger problem of climate change.](https://youtu.be/RSgXcFdHxFI?list=WL). Around 70% of emissions come for 100 companies. Push governments to transform the economy so individuals don't have all the pressure.

## Annual Review List

- [Egoistic Altruism](https://youtu.be/rvskMHn0sqQ): A Selfish Argument for Making the World a Better Place.
- [Optimistic Nihilism](https://youtu.be/MBRqu0YOH14): A great philosophy.
- [The Tail End](https://waitbutwhy.com/2015/12/the-tail-end.html): You have limited time, and you should spend it wisely in things and with people you care about.

## Journaling

- Journaling is a "keystone" habit. It tightly locks all of your other habits in place.
- When you are in an intensely emotional mood, journaling can help you more fully experience and understand those emotions.
- Journal about things, people, or situations for which you are grateful. Consider including negative situations like avoiding an accident, for instance.
- The development of a coherent narrative helps you reorganise and structure old memories, making them less traumatic.
- Writing on a regular basis may allow for repeated exposure to your old memories, which will help you get rid of your negative emotional responses.
- [Journaling is a tool you can use to better manage your mental health](https://nesslabs.com/dear-diary).
- There are many methods. Start with a simple one like "What worked, what didn’t, what’s next".

## DNA Genetic Testing and Analysis

- Companies like 23andMe look only at a few specific genomic coordinates that are known to be contain pathogenic variants, but chances are if you have the associated disease you don't have a variant at one of those few select locations. Because of this, [a negative test result does not mean someone isn't at risk for the condition](https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2019/02/01/opinion/23andme-cancer-dna-test-brca.html).
- If it says I don’t have something, then that means nothing. If it says I do have something, then that means I should be on the lookout for other corroborating data or symptoms.
- You can retrieve information about your DNA variations at [Promethease](https://promethease.com/)
- Genetic data may help people today, but it can also be sold to insurance companies.
- How valuable it would be giving your DNA to a competent advertising company? They could be able to profile and predict users with significantly higher personal accuracy.
  - This is analogous to the 1800s when people disagreed over whether one should let a camera take your photo. Ff sequencing prices and mobility continue to advance at current rates, in 30 years your DNA could be sequenced thousands of times a day, everywhere you go in public (the same way you're recorded with security cameras).
