## Fitness

- Never sit for prolonged times. Take breaks standing or walking around.
- Exercise helps make better use of the foods you are eating and produces the hormones you need to think clearly.
- Too much sugar leads to a heavy body. Too many distractions lead to a heavy mind.
- [It's been shown that the timing of your meals and more specifically your protein intake, doesn't make any difference to the growth of your muscles. Just get adequate protein and calories throughout the day, though you might want to eat something post workout anyway for energy.](https://www.reddit.com/r/leangains/comments/9fxkof/if_you_eat_a_big_preworkout_meal_do_you_need_to/)

### Posture

- Fix your habits. Spending 30 minutes stretching every day and an hour at the gym 3 times a week won't offset the more than 80 hours a week you probably spend sitting at your office, sofa, computer, etc.
- Pick certain moments where you would always check your posture. Walking through doorways, standing up, ...
- Another great tip is to brush your teeth with [your back against the wall](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GbGSvAEkE68) for 3 minutes.
- Exercise and live a less sedentary lifestyle. Focus on [building core strength](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4BOTvaRaDjI).

## Sleep

- Stick to a consistent routinne.

## Cooking

- When you have the best and tastiest ingredients, you can cook very simply and the food will be extraordinary because it tastes like what it is. Good cooking is no mystery.
- Experiment! The worst it couyld happen is that you don't like it. Cooking has a short feedback loop. Take risks and you'll get the payoffs. Learn from your mistakes until you succeed.

## Meditation

- Meditation is a simple practice available to all, which can reduce stress, increase calmness and clarity and promote happiness. Learning how to meditate is straightforward, and the benefits can come quickly. Even just a few minutes a day can make a big difference revealing and refactoring various [mental motions](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/WYmmC3W6ZNhEgAmWG/a-mechanistic-model-of-meditation#Uses_for_moments_of_introspective_awareness_).
  - If you have more introspective awareness of the exact processes that are happening in your mind, you can make more implicit assumptions conscious, causing your brain’s built-in contradiction detector to notice when they contradict your later learning. Also, getting more feedback about what exactly is happening in your mind allows you to notice more wasted motion in general.
- The goal of meditation is not to quit having thoughts, but to observe them, watch them without reacting and rationalizing them. This helps rewire the way your brain works similar to cognitive behavioral therapy. Typically, people who work towards this, have less anxiety and depression because they don’t react to every thought they have, which gives them a greater control of their emotions.
- [How to Meditate](https://www.nytimes.com/guides/well/how-to-meditate):
  1. Find a comfortable place to sit, and a posture that is both alert and relaxed at the same time. See if you can make the spine erect, without being too rigid.
  2. Close your eyes (or leave them slightly open if you prefer), and take a few slow breaths. Take a few moments to loosen your body from your head to your toes, and take a few more deep breaths. Scan your body to see if you can find any other tension that you can release.
  3. Stop to notice the sensations throughout your body — the warmth, the coolness or any discomfort. Be aware of them, but try not to fidget too much.
  4. Keep your attention on your breath. Your mind will wander. Notice it whenever it happens, congratulate yourself for having noticed it, and then return to the breath. After a few moments, your mind may wander again. Once again, notice that and simply return your attention back to the present moment.
