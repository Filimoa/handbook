# Time

Time is the most valuable and least replaceable resource. Just like money, [time must be explicitly managed](https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0). If you get 10% more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded difference is massive. Days are long but decades are short.

- Remember that you are dying. We have limited time and we must choose how to spend it. Unfortunately, we rarely take the time to consciously do this.
- Learn to prioritize, and value your time. "I don't have time" is another way of saying "it's not a priority". Busyness is a lack of priorities.
  - Doing one thing requires giving up another. Whenever you explicitly choose to do one thing, you implicitly choose not to do another thing.
  - Your work will be endless, but your time is finite. You cannot limit the work so you must limit your time. Hours are the only thing you can manage.
- Lists help you to summarize your next steps and to not lose focus. If you place them in a very visible place it makes easier to accomplish goals.
  - Decompose lists items into smaller steps.
- Doing the same thing over and over again without getting tired is what computers are good at, humans have other skills.
- If a task takes less than [two minutes](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating), do it. It'll make you more productive and also unclutter your mind task's backlog.
- Do the tasks in the right order! One strategy might be starting with the one that could make the others irrelevant or easier.
- Timeboxing is planning how you spend your days in advance and it's so effective because it allows you to iterate. If you didn't complete everything you outlined, you know exactly why -- because you've documented how you planned to spend your time.
- Success can be measured in the percentage of time you have under your control. [To achieve success](https://blog.samaltman.com/how-to-be-successful):
  - Compound yourself. Compounding is magic. Keep long-term thinking with a broad view of how different systems in the world are going to come together.
  - Learn to think independently.
  - Make it easy to take risks. Most people overestimate risk and underestimate reward. It's often easier to take risks early in your career; you don't have much to lose, and you potentially have a lot to gain.
  - Build a network. Help people as much as you can.
- Work expands to fill the time available. If you have six months to complete a task, it will take six months to complete. That's [Parkinson's law](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parkinson%27s_law).
- When you get an invitation to do something in the future, ask yourself: would you accept this if it was scheduled for tomorrow? Not too many promises will pass that immediacy filter.
- [Life is lived in 16 hours mini-episodes that we can affect](https://youtu.be/-dYgnvrvQ3M).
- [Protect attention](https://youtu.be/VpHyLG-sc4g). Attention is a ridiculously valuable resource and should be treated as such. Reduce cognitive load, reduce distractions, reduce mental clutter, etc.
  - Some activities will make you experience time quicker but won't provide any new and signifficant memories. Rapid stimullating streams of experience (news, twitter feed, mindless browsing, ...) will provide a fullness that will make time fly away. Retrospectively, they won't provide any fullfillment and make it seem like nothing happened.
  - Routines speed up your life. Time will blow by quicker if you are covered in meaningless routines. What is worse, your days will become blurred - each day - too similar to the next - for you brain to hold on to distinct memories. On the other hand, routines also help to reduce decision fatigue so that you have room for more important decisions. Make sure the routines you have are the ones you need.
- Things you use for a significant fraction of your life are worth investing in.
- The window of time we can expect things to remain the same is decreasing. Things change faster and faster. To save time we do "technology". [Technology gives us extra time and deeply affect how we live](https://youtu.be/zHL9GP_B30E).
- Mortality is the main source of scarcity. If we had infinite time, we would be less concerned with whether something was faster. The reason speed has value is because time has value; the reason time has value is because human life has value, and lifespans are finite. [If you made lifespans much longer, you'd reduce the effective cost of everything](https://balajis.com/the-purpose-of-technology/). The ultimate purpose of technology is to eliminate mortality.

## Productivity

- Define the task requirements and goals clearly.
- Done is better than perfect.
- Do the worst thing first. Give yourself a reward once you're done.
- Create smaller chunks. This helps getting in the flow (find the right balance between the challenge of the activity and your own skills levels). Avoid multitasking.
- Leverage the power of positive pressure by publicly committing to your goals.
- [Improve your environment](https://nesslabs.com/neuroscience-of-procrastination). Design your workspace in a way that minimizes distractions, whether physical or digital.
- What is optimal for me won't be optimal for you. You'll have to experiment to find out what works best for you.
- Keep a log of what happened each day. You can also add what you've learned!
- Create checklist for repetitive processes. For example, a checklist detailing all the task to do before ending the day.
- "Where is the good knife?" If you're looking for your good X, you have bad Xs. Throw those out.

## Focus

[Focus (absorption, concentration) is the ability to narrow the attention so as to apply it in a more detailed and penetrating way for sustained periods of time on some chosen part of your present experience](https://www.lesswrong.com/s/xqgwpmwDYsn8osoje/p/35eEHAXis3jMqETod).

- Whatever your primary motivations are in life, you won't get anywhere by waiting for something to happen. Plan!
  - Humans do not think strategically by default.
- Environmental changes can make it easier to attend effectively to the right things.
  - Removing clutter and other distractions can make attention less difficult, for which the virtues of orderliness and simplicity can help.
  - Disable notifications and badges so that you don't mindlessly open distracting apps.
- [Mindfulness meditation](health.md###meditation), e.g. breath-counting, seems to be a go-to technique for developing focus.
- Periodic exposure to nature and out-of-doors in an unstressful, undemanding way can restore attention capability.

## Investing

- Today's savings buy tomorrow's liberty. Think long term. [A dollar today is worth more than a dollar tomorrow](https://putanumonit.com/2017/02/10/get-rich-slowly/). People will take that dollar and do something profitable with it.
- Saving money and investing money are both good habits. Small amounts of money invested regularly for many decades without deliberation is one path to wealth.
- Before you get into investing, get into [budgeting](https://www.reddit.com/r/ynab/comments/8d4ab4/what_is_the_best_approach_for_budgeting_savings/).
- The way to avoid specific risk is through diversification.
