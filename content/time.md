# Time

Just like money, [time must be explicitly managed][time-management].

- Learn to prioritize, and value your time. "I don't have time" is another way of saying "it's not a priority".
- Lists help you to summarize your next steps and to not lose focus. If you place them in a very visible place it makes easier to accomplish goals.
- Doing the same thing over and over again without getting tired is what computers are good at, humans have other skills.
- If a task takes less than [two minutes][two-minutes-rule], do it. It'll make you more productive and also declutter your mind task's backlog.
