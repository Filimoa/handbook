# Time

Time is the most valuable and least replaceable resource. Just like money, [time must be explicitly managed](https://youtu.be/oTugjssqOT0). If you get 10% more done and 1% better every day compared to someone else, the compounded difference is massive.

* Learn to prioritize, and value your time. "I don't have time" is another way of saying "it's not a priority".
* Lists help you to summarize your next steps and to not lose focus. If you place them in a very visible place it makes easier to accomplish goals.
  * Decompose lists items into smaller steps.
* Doing the same thing over and over again without getting tired is what computers are good at, humans have other skills.
* If a task takes less than [two minutes](https://jamesclear.com/how-to-stop-procrastinating), do it. It'll make you more productive and also declutter your mind task's backlog.
* Do the tasks in the right order! One strategy might be starting with the one that could make the others irrelevant or easiers.

## Productivity

* Define the task requirements and goals clearly.
* Do the worst thing first. Give yourself a reward once you're done.
* Create smaller chunks. This helps getting in the flow (find the right balance between the challenge of the activity and your own skills levels). Avoid multitasking.
* Leverage the power of positive pressure by publicly committing to your goals.
* [Improve your environment](https://nesslabs.com/neuroscience-of-procrastination). Design your workspace in a way that minimises distractions, whether physical or digital.
* What is optimal for me won’t be optimal for you. You’ll have to experiment to find out what works best for you.
