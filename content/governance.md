# Governance

## Politics

- To debate politics as in any other field, first gather information and then decide. [Think like a scientist](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/09/thinking-ladder.html).
- Think of it as a complex system. Everything is related and has unexpected consequences. Don't misattribute systemic failures to scapegoats.
- Don't attach to any movement so it doesn't become part of your identity. Arguments are soldiers. Once you attach to one side, you must support all arguments of that side, and attack all arguments that appear to favor the enemy side.
- Political ideologies are mostly wrong. For most issues it's makes a lot more sense to study the issue in detail than try to have an opinion based on pre-cached ideology. It's just better to discuss issues without invoking teams.
  - Issues are rarely binary. The political parties make it seem so to make it work with their political interests. When you spot a binary question, think if its really a binary one or could be much more nuanced.
- Democracy is the worst form of government, except for all the others â€” Winston Churchill [_probably quoting someone else_](https://richardlangworth.com/worst-form-of-government).
- If you think politics is annoying, then it's because you're privileged enough for it to not matter.
- Don't forget two things: your perception of reality has probably been at least a little manipulated, and your opponents are behaving the way they are based on a perception of reality that's different from your own.
  - What does this look/feel like to the people I don't know?
- [Coordination](https://vitalik.ca/general/2020/09/11/coordination.html), the ability for large groups of actors to work together for their common interest, is one of the most powerful forces in the universe. It can be improved in many ways:
  - Faster spread of information.
  - Better norms that identify what behaviors are classified as cheating along with more effective punishments.
  - Stronger and more powerful organizations.
  - Tools like smart contracts that allow interactions with reduced levels of trust.
  - Governance technologies (voting, shares, decision markets...)

### [Voting Theory](https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/D6trAzh6DApKPhbv4/a-voting-theory-primer-for-rationalists)

- [No silver bullet](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Arrow%27s_impossibility_theorem).
- [Politics In The Animal Kingdom](http://www.cgpgrey.com/politics-in-the-animal-kingdom/) is a great summary of a few methods.
- There are [better ways to build a ballot](https://ncase.me/ballot/).
- Approval voting is usually a good choice. Is simple to explain and to count, and comprehensibility is an important factor when choosing a voting method. That said, there are [really good alternatives](https://electionscience.github.io/vse-sim/VSEbasic/).
