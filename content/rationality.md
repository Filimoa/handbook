# Rationality

- You can try things to find out which ideas are right or wrong. It requirest asking "What else would be true if this thing were true?" or "What would be different depending on whether X versus Y were true?".
- Aim to get an accurate picture of reality, even when that's unpleasant.
- Local Validity: Some argument steps are allowed steps and some argument steps aren't, indenpendently of whether they arrive at an answer you agree with.
- People can fool you by saying they saw things that they didn't see, telling you some things they know but not others or by using flawed steps when drawing conclussions. When you try to make an argument come out with a particular answer, tou can fool yourself in the same way.
- You can be the wrong person.
- Assume good faith. Trust the other person to be believing things that make sense to them, which you'd have ended up believing if you were exposed to the same stimuli, and that they are generally trying to find the the truth.
- [Notice](https://agentyduck.blogspot.com/2014/12/how-to-train-noticing.html) your internal state (cognitive and emotional). Notice when you are in a failure mode, and step out. For example:
  - [Motivated Reasoning or Soldier Mindset](https://youtu.be/w4RLfVxTGH4?list=WL):
    - You are fighting to make sure an argument wins.
    - You are fighting to make another argument lose.
  - You are incentivized to believe something, or not to notice something, because of social or financial rewards.
  - You're incentivized not to notice something or think it's important because it'd be physically inconvenient/annoying.
  - You are offended/angered/defensive/agitated.
  - You are afraid you'll lose something important if you lose a belief.
  - You are arguing about definitions of words instead of ideas.
  - You are confused or surprised. Treat this as a red flag that something about your models is wrong.
- Notice if someone else seems to be in one of the above failure modes.
- Tactfully disagree in a way that arouses curiosity rather than defensiveness.
- Leave your colleague a line of retreat.
- Socially reward people who change their mind.
- Take into account second and third order effects.

## Making Decisions

- Decision making is the process we use to identify and choose alternatives, producing a final choice, which may or may not result in an action. It's basically a problem-solving activity, and it can be more or less rational or irrational based on the decision maker's values, beliefs, and (perceived) knowledge.
- The decisions you make fall into two categories:
  - Prioritizing — Which path should you take first?
  - Allocating — How much attention, time, and capital should you spend on this?
- To maximize your long-term happiness, prioritize the projects you'd most regret not having pursued by the time you're old and looking back at your life.
- Gather all the information you can. Then, schedule time to think deeply about it. Remember that too much information increases confidence not accuracy.
- If all options are similar take the harder one in the short term \(_Hard decisions easy life, easy decisions, hard life_\).
- Look for win-win decisions. If someone has to lose, you're not thinking hard enough or you need to make structural/environmental changes.
- The rule of 5. Think about what the decision looks like 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years, 5 decades.
- Ask what information would cause you to change your mind. If you don't have that information, find it. If you do, track is religiously. Collect feedback and be open to change outcomes.
- How un-doable is a decision? If an idea is fully un-doable, make it as quickly as you can. When a decision is something that you can't take back, then it's worth really, really understanding. Aim for preserving optionality.
- We are all susceptible to bias, almost all the time. A way to detect bias and minimize the decision impact is to [run it by a bias checklist](https://www.businessinsider.com/read-this-checklist-before-you-make-any-decisions-2011-6?IR=T).
- [There are many reasons why smart people may make a poor decision](https://nesslabs.com/decision-making); Overconfidence, Analysis paralysis, Information overload, Lack of emotional or physical resources, ...
- Decision making styles:
  - Intuitive vs. Rational. System 1 vs System 2.
  - Maximising vs. Satisficing. Go for the optimal decisionor simply try to find a solution that is good enough.
  - Well defined goal vs. blurred objective. Planning all the details or trying to be as flexible as possible.
- How to make smart decisions once you have the data (DECIDE framework):
  1. Define the problem. Understand the problem at hand.
  1. Establish the criteria. List all the factors you want to consider before making a decision.
  1. Consider the alternatives. Do enough research to have a few solid alternatives.
  1. Identify the best alternative. See which alternative makes most sense based on your criteria.
  1. Develop and implement a plan of action. Act on that decision.
  1. Evaluate the solution. In order to make better decisions over time, examine the outcomes and the feedback you get.

## [Problem Solving](http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/culture-is-a-shared-mechanism-for-problem-solving/)

- Problems have multiple solutions at multiple levels.
- Humans get obsessed with solutions rather than first building an obsession with a problem. Obsess around problems, not solutions.
- Most of the time problems already have solutions:
  - The first group of people that encounter a problem don't know how to solve it.
  - They figure out a way of doing it, and when they get to a solution that's good enough \(not perfect, just good enough\), that's what they settle on.
  - The next time they encounter the problem, they use the same solution.
  - That keeps happening until later people don't even think about how to do it. [It's just how things are done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect).
- The best thing that can be done to a problem is to dissolve it, to redesign the entity that has it or its environment so as to eliminate the problem.
  - A problem well stated is a problem half solved.
  - Insight is best thought of as a change in problem representation. The way we frame problems makes them more or less difficult.
- [Problem solving can be understood as a search problem](https://rs.io/the-science-of-problem-solving/). You start in some state, there's a set of neighbor states you can move to, and a final state that you would like to end up in.
- Taking breaks during working on a problem solving is called incubation. Incubation enhances problem solving ability.
- To improve problem solving, one should study solved problems, attack the problem while in different moods, and try explaining the problem to others.
- Grossman's Law: Complex problems have simple, easy to understand wrong answers.
- Aim for a Minimum Viable Solution. **Start small and iterate**. Fail early and learn from it. That allows you to explore, then exploit.
- When we have a problem, our instinct is to add a new habit or purchase a fix. But sometimes, you can improve your life by taking things away ([Via Negativa](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/via-negativa-adding-to-your-life-by-subtracting/)). For example, the foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat.
