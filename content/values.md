# Values

Values are what you stand for in life — they are often things that you are for or against — what you believe in and are willing to support and stand up for. Values make you even if you don't know what are yours. You are what you do (eat, listen, read, watch). Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on. These are the values I try to stand for. **Curious, Mindful and Open**.

## Curiousity

- Never stop [learning](learning.md).
  - Read about topics you care, observe the world around you and keep a beginner's mind (*shoshin*).
  - Don't be afraid to ask a question that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
  - Test your assumptions/beliefs as many times as possible. Knowledge is a powerful tool. The more you [feel like a noob](http://paulgraham.com/noob.html), the better.
- Whatever is you work on, is worthwhile as long as you share your learnings. In the worst case, if your idea doesn't work out, the community will have learned better why that approach doesn't make sense.
- Fail early and often. There is only one guaranteed way you'll won't get something you want, and that's not to pursue it.
- Practice [rational](rationality.md) thinking.
  - Absolute truth is relative to everyone and you don't know everything.
  - Stress test your ideas with experiments and facts. Everything you know or do could be wrong.
  - We do not know what we don't know. Gather as much context as you can before making any final statement.
  - Avoid forming an opinion at all about things that are not evident. Your opinions are not yours and they are holding you back.
  - Research before judging! [No one knows everything and everyone is doing the best they can](https://letterstoanewdeveloper.com/2019/08/12/there-are-no-adults-in-the-room/). These are opportunities for you to help and learn more about the world.
  - You need a view of both the micro and the macro, the forest and the trees — and how both perspectives slot together.
- Run your brain in debug mode so you understand why you're thinking in that way.
- Think in distributions instead of [magic answers](http://cassandraxia.com/cogbiases). The world is [analog and not digital](https://waitbutwhy.com/2019/12/political-disney-world.html), continuous and not discrete. Real people are complex and flawed, full of faults but almost always worthy of compassion. Each turn of events is mired in potential positives and potential negatives, which is a mess to sort out.
  - Digitizing an analog view will result in some loss of information. In that world, everything is good or bad, everyone is smart or ignorant, ones and zeros.
- Mental models and [other concepts](concepts.md) can help us think more effectively.
- Remix ideas. Ideas are impacted by evolution. The most useful ones survive and evolve. [Innovation is product of the combinations of ideas](https://youtu.be/XUAIIQFoufs?list=WL).
- Live Smarter not Harder. Don't complain about stuff you can easily fix, automate, or delegate. Money can buy [time](time.md). Accomplish more with less.
- Knowing more about the world makes you enjoy it more. [Understanding how music is made increases the pleasure you get from music](https://youtu.be/JbVfcZxfIZo?list=WL).
  - [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail). Surprising detail is a near universal property of getting up close and personal with reality. You experience lots of these details the first time you do something new!

## Mindfulness

- Enjoy Life. Appreciate the fact that [you're alive](https://youtu.be/9D05ej8u-gU). Be grateful about it and practice [mindfulness](https://youtu.be/hQo-CQzoW24).
- Make time to reflect. Don't waste time doing anything by momentum if you don't enjoy it. Not doing something that isn't worth doing is a wonderful way to spend your time. Happiness is a choice.
- One task at a time. No distractions.
- KISS. When [communicating](communications.md), do it in a clear and concise way. When [facing a problem](rationality.md#problem-solving), prefer a **lean** approach with a simple solution and built upon it. Re-framing questions will make easy to give simpler solutions. What would this look like if it was simple?
- Remove friction. Focus on essentials.
- Keep Calm.
  - Think, understand, and listen before [communicating](communications.md).
  - Try to plan the possible outcomes and don't rush.
  - Don't worry too much about things that won't matter to you or your loved ones in 10 years.
  - Assume positive intent. No one is your enemy, you're an NPC in their game.
  - Every person is inherently valuable independent of behavior and beliefs. Create safe spaces for people, and a dangerous space for ideas ([idea labs](https://mobile.twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1278035160454348800)). When you have a nice thing to say about someone, say it to them right away, instead of waiting. You might not see them again.
- Enjoy everything as a child does. Prefer delayed gratification, that is, making short term sacrifices to get long term benefits.
- Don't be a [whatever person](https://medium.com/@courtneyseiter/the-tribe-of-whatever-or-how-i-learned-to-make-a-decision-8ab0a76f1f0c#.vj7olnmm5). Don't be afraid to make decisions and actively take them! All decision making — even if small ones — can be a good practice for the bigger ones you'll face.
- Reality is neutral. Reality has no judgments. To a tree, there's no concept of right or wrong or good or bad. You're born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences… and then you die. How you choose to interpret that is up to you. And you do have that choice. Our internal state shapes how we experience the external state.

## Opennes

- Embrace Weirdness. Don't be another human. Find your place, do what you love and put yourself outside the comfort zone. Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting.
- Embrace change. Don't complain about things you can't change. Be proactive.
- Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, [habits](habits.md), behavior, and points of view. No one can compete with you on being you.
- Share your decisions and ideas so flaws arise earlier in the process.
- [Maintain a very small identity](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html). Do not affiliate your identity with anything extrinsic - such as a religion, political party, country, company, profession, programming language, social class, etc. You're not your ideas.
- Honesty demands that we communicate any uncertainty we may feel about the relevance of our own opinions.
- One of the hardest excercises is to receive [feedback](communications.md#feedback). Ask for it and be ready to change. Aim to improve once you've gathered feedback and reflected on it.
