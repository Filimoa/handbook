# Values

Values are what you stand for in life — they are often things that you are for or against — what you believe in and are willing to support and stand up for. Values make you even if you don't know what are yours. These are the values I try to stand for. **Curious, Mindful and Open**.

## Curiousity

- Never stop learning. Read about topics you care, observe the world around you, don't be afraid to ask silly questions and test your assumptions as many times as possible. Knowledge is a powerful tool.
- Whatever is you work on, is worthwhile as long as you share your learnings. In the worst case, if your idea doesn't work out, the community will have learned better why that approach doesn't make sense.
- Fail early and often. There is only one guaranteed way you'll won't get something you want, and that's not to pursue it. Everyone's making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.
- Practice rational thinking. Make sure you understand that the absolute truth is relative to everyone and you don't know everything. We do not know what we don't know. Gather as much context as you can before making any final statement. Avoid forming an opinion at all about things that are not evident. Research deeply before judging!
- Run your brain in debug mode so you understand why you're thinking in that way.
- [Mental models](https://medium.com/@yegg/mental-models-i-find-repeatedly-useful-936f1cc405d#.qmy99z6ug) can help us thinking more effectively and is always good to know argument fallacies.
- Stress test your ideas with experiments and facts.
- Live Smarter not Harder. Don't complain about stuff you can easily fix, automate, or delegate. Money can buy time. Accomplish more with less.
- Knowing more about the world makes you enjoy it more. [Understanding how music is made increases the pleasure you get from music](https://youtu.be/JbVfcZxfIZo?list=WL).

## Mindfulness

- Enjoy Life. Appreciate the fact that [you're alive](https://youtu.be/9D05ej8u-gU). Be grateful about it and practice [mindfulness](https://youtu.be/hQo-CQzoW24).
- Make time to reflect. Don't waste time doing anything by momentum if you don't enjoy it. Happiness is a choice. Treat the world as a movie of your life and let yourself be the hero of that movie.
- KISS. When communicating, do it in a clear and concise way. When facing a problem, prefer a **lean** approach with a simple solution and built upon it. Re-framing questions will make easy to give simpler solutions.
- Remove friction. Focus on essentials.
- Keep Calm. Think, understand, and listen before speaking. Try to plan the possible outcomes and don't rush. Don't worry too much about things that won't matter to you or your loved ones in 10 years.
- See and enjoy everything as a child. Prefer delayed gratification, that is, making short term sacrifices to get long term benefits.
- One task at a time. No distractions.
- Don't be a [whatever person](https://medium.com/@courtneyseiter/the-tribe-of-whatever-or-how-i-learned-to-make-a-decision-8ab0a76f1f0c#.vj7olnmm5). Don't be afraid to make decisions and actively take them! All decision making — even if small ones — can be a good practice for the bigger ones you’ll face.

## Opennes

- Embrace Weirdness. Don't be just another human. Find your place, do what you love and put yourself outside the comfort zone. Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting.
- Embrace change. Don't complain about things you can't change. Be proactive.
- Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, habits, behavior, and points of view. No one can compete with you on being you.
- Share your decisions and ideas so flaws arise earlier in the process. Maintain a very small identity. Do not affiliate your identity with anything extrinsic - such as a religion, political party, country, company, profession, programming language, social class, etc.
- One of the hardest excercises is to receive feedback. Ask for it and be ready to change. Aim to improve once you've gathered feedback and reflected on it.
