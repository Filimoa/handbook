# Values

Values are what you stand for in life — they are often things that you are for or against — what you believe in and are willing to support and stand up for. Values make you even if you don't know what are yours.

You are what you do (eat, listen, read, watch). Not what you say, not what you believe, not how you vote, but what you spend your time on. These are the values I try to stand for. **Curious, Mindful and Open**.

## Curiosity

- Never stop [learning](learning.md).
  - Read about topics you care, observe the world around you and keep a beginner's mind (*shoshin*).
  - Don't be afraid to [ask a question](rationality.md##asking-questions) that may sound stupid because 99% of the time everyone else is thinking of the same question and is too embarrassed to ask it.
  - Knowledge is a powerful tool. The more you [feel like a noob](http://paulgraham.com/noob.html), the better.
  - [Reality has a surprising amount of detail](http://johnsalvatier.org/blog/2017/reality-has-a-surprising-amount-of-detail). Knowing more about the world makes you enjoy it more. [Understanding how music is made increases the pleasure you get from music](https://youtu.be/JbVfcZxfIZo).
- Practice [rational](rationality.md) thinking. Learn [mental models and other concepts](concepts.md) that help us think more effectively.
- Do stuff! Whatever is you work on, is worthwhile as long as you share your learnings. In the worst case, if your [ideas](random/ideas.md) don't work out, the community will learn why that approach doesn't make sense.
  - Remix ideas. Ideas are impacted by evolution. The most useful ones survive and evolve. [Innovation is product of the combinations of ideas](https://youtu.be/XUAIIQFoufs).
  - Fail early and often. There is only one guaranteed way you'll won't get something you want, and that's not to pursue it. [Mistakes](https://meta.wikimedia.org/wiki/So_you%27ve_made_a_mistake_and_it%27s_public...) are the portals of discovery.
  - [If you think you’re going to regret not doing something, you should probably do it](https://blog.samaltman.com/the-days-are-long-but-the-decades-are-short). Most people regret far more things they didn’t do than things they did do.
- Run your brain in debug mode so you understand why you're thinking in that way. The brain hasn't changed that much in the last few thousands years and was built for a different world.

## Mindfulness

- Enjoy Life. Enjoy people. Appreciate the fact that [you're alive](https://youtu.be/9D05ej8u-gU). Be grateful and [mindful](health.md##meditation) about it. You take things for granted, and then they're gone. Don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. Be present and enjoy the moment as a child does. [Life is short](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html), [enjoy the silly bit in between](https://youtu.be/-mu780uB7mI). More so knowing that [humans quickly return to a relatively stable level of happiness despite major positive or negative events or life changes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hedonic_treadmill).
- Make time to reflect. Don't waste time doing anything by momentum if you don't enjoy it. Not doing something that isn't worth doing is a wonderful way to spend your time. Look at the big picture and don't climb the current mountain out of inertia (ranks in business, status among friends, ...).
- One task at a time. [No distractions](time.md##focus).
- KISS. What would less/simple look like?
  - When [communicating](communications.md), do it in a clear and concise way.
  - When [facing a problem](rationality.md#problem-solving), prefer a lean approach with a simple solution and built upon it. Re-framing problems will make easy to give simpler solutions. How would it look like if it was simple?
  - Remove friction. Focus on essentials. Complexity itself has costs. It makes life harder to manage, reduces our degrees of freedom, and so forth. Often people do not factor those costs into their decisions as they incrementally and inattentively complexify their lives. A person with the virtue of simplicity asks, of any decision they make, "does this make my life more complex, and if so is that worth it?"
- Live smarter, not harder. Don't complain about stuff you can easily fix, automate, or delegate. Money can buy [time](time.md).
- Keep Calm. Own and deal with your emotions. [Focus on what you can control](health.md#stoicism). Try to plan the possible outcomes and don't rush.
- Think, understand, and listen before [communicating](communication/communications.md).
- Don't worry too much about things that won't matter to you or your loved ones in 10 years.
- Assume positive intent. No one is your enemy, you're an NPC in their game. Everyone is the main character of their own movie (sonder).
  - Every person is inherently valuable independent of behavior and beliefs. Create safe spaces for people, and a dangerous space for ideas ([idea labs](https://mobile.twitter.com/waitbutwhy/status/1278035160454348800)).
  - When you have a nice thing to say about someone, say it to them right away, instead of waiting. You might not see them again.
  - Don't punish people for trying. You teach them to not try things or not to try them with you.
- Prefer delayed gratification, making short term sacrifices to get long term benefits.
- Don't be a [whatever person](https://medium.com/@courtneyseiter/the-tribe-of-whatever-or-how-i-learned-to-make-a-decision-8ab0a76f1f0c#.vj7olnmm5). Don't be afraid to make decisions and actively take them! All decision making — even if small ones — can be a good practice for the bigger ones you'll face.
- Don't judge. Reality is neutral. To a tree, there's no concept of right or wrong or good or bad. You're born, you have a whole set of sensory experiences... and then you die. How you choose to interpret that is up to you. And you do have that choice. Why are you taking something so seriously?
- Be aware of your internal state. Making this more visible makes a better feedback loop. Ask yourself, as many times as possible every day "Am I conscious now?". Our internal state shapes how we experience the external state.
- Humans are messy and life is messy. Yet we try to fit everything into [human made buckets](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/11/21/the-categories-were-made-for-man-not-man-for-the-categories/). Losing most of the nuance in the process.
- Recognize that tradeoffs happen everywhere. List them explicitly.
  - We trade time against money against effort against happiness against social capital — we can do so blindly, and hope for the best, or we can think about them carefully and deliberately, and take advantage of opportunities to get more of everything (arbitrage). Identify all your relevant currencies, and note which are being spent faster or are more valuable.
- Appreciate what you have. [Don't overestimate the hedonic impact of future events](https://waitbutwhy.com/2013/11/life-is-picture-but-you-live-in-pixel.html). [Showing gratitude for the good things you have is the most powerful happiness boosting activity there is](https://youtu.be/WPPPFqsECz0). There's no second chance at life. [This is the one chance you have to live as a talking monkey in space at the best point in history as the smartest species on the planet using magic on a daily basis like the internet and jet planes and smartphones with access to all human knowledge at your fingertips and the chance to talk about how cool being alive is](https://youtu.be/VLAAy_pM-k8).
- Do not change because of what others or society want, change because of what you want. It's easy to get carried by the environment and start doing things you don't want to do.
- Ignore the irrational and [unproductive obsession](https://waitbutwhy.com/2014/06/taming-mammoth-let-peoples-opinions-run-life.html) with what other people think of you. Figure out what actually matters to you and live according to it.
- [What gives you energy and what sucks your energy?](https://twitter.com/rrhoover/status/1346268904239161344) Figure it out and act accordingly.

## Openness

- Embrace Weirdness. Don't be another human. Find your place, do what you love and put yourself outside the comfort zone. Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting. [If you fit in you disappear](https://twitter.com/tobi/status/1319017087948435458).
- Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, [habits](habits.md), behavior, and points of view. No one can compete with you on being you.
- Share your decisions, state, and ideas early so flaws arise earlier in the process.
- [Maintain a very small identity](http://www.paulgraham.com/identity.html). The act of labeling yourself is the act of restricting yourself to what you think fits that label. Avoid forming an opinion at all about things that are not evident. Do not affiliate your identity with anything extrinsic - such as a religion, political party, country, company, profession, programming language, social class, etc. You're not your opinions. Opinions are external objects. Don't define yourself by what you work on or what you hate.
- Communicate any uncertainty you may feel about the relevance of your own opinions.
- One of the hardest exercises is to receive [feedback](communications.md#feedback). Ask for it and be ready to change. Aim to improve once you've gathered feedback and reflected on it.
- Experience things again (books, movies, ...). They might be the same, but you change and are a different person now. The world changes, too. No one steps in the same river twice.
- Look for new experiences. It is the most important factor for [memorable experiences](https://travelopment.com/how-to-create-memorable-experiences/). When all days follow the same routine, [there is no way to differentiate the memories](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zHL9GP_B30E).
