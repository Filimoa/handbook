# Values

Values are what you stand for in life — they are often things that you are for or against — what you believe in and are willing to support and stand up for. Values make you even if you don't know what are yours. These are the values I try to stand for.

## Be Curious

Never stop learning. Read about topics you care, observe the world around you, don't be afraid to ask silly questions and test your assumptions as many times as possible. Knowledge is a powerful tool.

Whatever is you work on, is worthwhile as long as you share your learnings. In the worst case, if your idea doesn't work out, the community will have learned better why that approach doesn't make sense. There is only one guaranteed way you'll won't get something you want, and that's not to pursue it. Everyone's making it up as they go along. Figure it out yourself, and do it.

## Open Your Mind

Practice rational thinking. Make sure you understand that the absolute truth is relative to everyone and you don't know everything. We do not know what we don't know. Gather as much context as you can before making any final statement. Avoid forming an opinion at all about things that are not evident. Researched deeply before judging! Run your brain in debug mode so you understand why you're thinking in that way.

One of the hardest excercises is to receive feedback. Ask for it and be ready to change. Aim to improve once you've gathered feedback and reflected on it. Stress test with facts and share your decisions so flaws arise earlier in the process.

## KISS

When communicating, do it in a clear and concise way. When facing a problem, prefer a **lean** approach with a simple solution and built upon it. Re-framing questions will make easy to give simpler solutions.

## Enjoy Life

Appreciate the fact that [you're alive](https://youtu.be/9D05ej8u-gU). Be grateful about it and practice [mindfulness](https://youtu.be/hQo-CQzoW24). Make time to reflect. Don't waste time doing anything by momentum if you don't enjoy it. Happiness is a choice. Treat the world as a movie of your life and let yourself be the hero of that movie. See and enjoy everything as a child. Prefer delayed gratification, that is, making short term sacrifices to get long term benefits.

## Embrace Weirdness

Don't be just another human. Find your place, do what you love and put yourself outside the comfort zone. Unexpected and unconventional things make life more interesting. Celebrate and encourage quirky gifts, habits, behavior, and points of view. No one can compete with you on being you.

## Keep Calm

Think, understand, and listen before speaking. Try to plan the possible outcomes and don't rush. Don't worry too much about things that won't matter to you or your loved ones in 10 years.

Don't be a [whatever person](https://medium.com/@courtneyseiter/the-tribe-of-whatever-or-how-i-learned-to-make-a-decision-8ab0a76f1f0c#.vj7olnmm5). Don't be afraid to make decisions and actively take them! All decision making — even if small ones — can be a good practice for the bigger ones you’ll face.

Maintain a very small identity. Do not affiliate your identity with anything extrinsic - such as a religion, political party, country, company, profession, programming language, social class, etc.

## Live Smarter not Harder

Don't complain about stuff you can easily fix, automate, or delegate. Money can buy time. Accomplish more with less.
