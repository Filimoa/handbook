# Concepts

## Fallacies

A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning. Logical fallacies are like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often sneakily used by politicians and the media to fool people. There's a [cool website](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) designed to help us identify and call out dodgy logic wherever it may raise its ugly, incoherent head.

## Mental Models

A mental model is a thought process about how something works in the real world. They can help to shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems \(a personal algorithm\). The world always makes sense. But it can be confusing. When it is, your model of the world is wrong. Millions of mental models exists, and every discipline has their own set. Some of them overlap and might be called differently.

## Rationality

* You can try things to find out which ideas are right or wrong. It requirest asking "What else would be true if this thing were true?" or "What would be different depending on whether X versus Y were true?".
* Local Validity: Some argument steps are allowed steps and some argument steps aren't, indenpendently of whether they arrive at an answer you agree with.
* People can fool you by saying they saw things that they didn't see, telling you some things they know but not others or by using flawed steps when drawing conclussions. When you try to make an argument come out with a particular answer, tou can fool yourself in the same way.

## Conceptual Compression

From time to time, look for abstractions that can compress the information behind them. This way you can reduce mental space. When needed, you can expand the abstraction and go deeper. This is used a lot in programming, where a new tool or package emerges taking care of that was previously done by human minds \(OMRs vs hand writen SQL\)!

Conceptual compression also allows lazy learning. If you're using the compressed version you don't need to care about what's behind. If you need, you can learn it at that time. Not everything needs to be learned upfront.

## Making Decisions

* Decision making is the process we use to identify and choose alternatives, producing a final choice, which may or may not result in an action. It’s basically a problem-solving activity, and it can be more or less rational or irrational based on the decision maker’s values, beliefs, and (perceived) knowledge.
* The decisions you make fall into two categories:
  * Prioritizing — Which path should you take first?
  * Allocating — How much attention, time, and capital should you spend on this?
* To maximize your long-term happiness, prioritize the projects you’d most regret not having pursued by the time you’re old and looking back at your life.
* Gather all the information you can. Then, schedule time to think deeply about it. Remember that too much information increases confidence not accuracy.
* If all options are similar take the harder one in the short term \(_Hard decisions easy life, easy decisions, hard life_\).
* Look for win-win decisions. If someone has to lose, you’re not thinking hard enough or you need to make structural/environmental changes.
* The rule of 5. Think about what the decision looks like 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years, 5 decades.
* Ask what information would cause you to change your mind. If you don’t have that information, find it. If you do, track is religiously. Collect feedback and be open to change outcomes.
* How un-doable is a decision? If an idea is fully un-doable, make it as quickly as you can. When a decision is something that you can’t take back, then it’s worth really, really understanding. Aim for preserving optionality.
* We are all susceptible to bias, almost all the time. A way to detect bias and minimize the decision impact is to [run it by a bias checklist](https://www.businessinsider.com/read-this-checklist-before-you-make-any-decisions-2011-6?IR=T).
* [There are many reasons why smart people may make a poor decision](https://nesslabs.com/decision-making); Overconfidence, Analysis paralysis, Information overload, Lack of emotional or physical resources, ...
* Decision making styles:
  * Intuitive vs. Rational. System 1 vs System 2.
  * Maximising vs. Satisficing. Go for the optimal decisionor simply try to find a solution that is good enough.
  * Well defined goal vs. blurred objective. Planning all the details or trying to be as flexible as possible.
* How to make smart decisions once you have the data (DECIDE framework):
  1. Define the problem. Understand the problem at hand.
  1. Establish the criteria. List all the factors you want to consider before making a decision.
  1. Consider the alternatives. Do enough research to have a few solid alternatives.
  1. Identify the best alternative. See which alternative makes most sense based on your criteria.
  1. Develop and implement a plan of action. Act on that decision.
  1. Evaluate the solution. In order to make better decisions over time, examine the outcomes and the feedback you get.

## [Problem Solving](http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/culture-is-a-shared-mechanism-for-problem-solving/)

* Problems have multiple solutions at multiple levels.
* Humans get obsessed with solutions rather than first building an obsession with a problem. Obsess around problems, not solutions.
* Most of the time problems already have solutions:
  * The first group of people that encounter a problem don't know how to solve it.
  * They figure out a way of doing it, and when they get to a solution that's good enough \(not perfect, just good enough\), that's what they settle on.
  * The next time they encounter the problem, they use the same solution.
  * That keeps happening until later people don't even think about how to do it. [It's just how things are done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect).
* The best thing that can be done to a problem is to dissolve it, to redesign the entity that has it or its environment so as to eliminate the problem.
  * Insight is best thought of as a change in problem representation. The way we frame problems makes them more or less difficult.
* [Problem solving can be understood as a search problem](https://rs.io/the-science-of-problem-solving/). You start in some state, there’s a set of neighbor states you can move to, and a final state that you would like to end up in.
* Taking breaks during working on a problem solving is called incubation. Incubation enhances problem solving ability.
* To improve problem solving, one should study solved problems, attack the problem while in different moods, and try explaining the problem to others.
* Aim for a Minimum Viable Solution. **Start small and iterate**. Fail early and learn from it. That allows you to explore, then exploit.
* When we have a problem, our instinct is to add a new habit or purchase a fix. But sometimes, you can improve your life by taking things away ([Via Negativa](https://www.artofmanliness.com/articles/via-negativa-adding-to-your-life-by-subtracting/)). For example, the foods you avoid are more important than the foods you eat.

## Processes

Whether you’re compiling code or making breakfast, everything can be modeled as a repeatable process. Understanding the elements of production — inputs, outputs, timing, limiting steps, quality controls, variability — lets us create and improve the _machinery_ needed to fulfill our goals. We all aim to achieve the same thing: high quality results in less time with least waste.

> If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing. — W. Edwards Deming

Write down processes and iterate over them. You cannot improve what you cannot explain.

As [Tobi Lütke points out in the Farnam Streen podcast](https://fs.blog/tobi-lutke/), _there are three kinds of processes_. There’s a kind of process that makes things that were previously impossible to do, possible. That’s good. Then there’s a kind of process that makes something that was previously possible significantly simpler, which is also good. And then there’s everything else \(just telling people to behave slightly different from what common sense tells them to do\).

You can [optimize processes](https://youtu.be/lhbLNBqhQkc) through [experiments](https://rs.io/how-to-get-started-with-anything/) and experiences removing barriers or adding tools.

Properties to look for in Processes:

* Algorithmic. So you don't need to think about choices. This reduces mental overhead and anxiety (The Paradox of Choice).
  * A way to reduce choices i self binding (like Ulyses did). Limiting our actions in the future will reduce the choices we'll need to do.
* Flexible. Make if fluid enough to keep up with changes.
* Low Friction. Simple processes are easier to understand and apply.
* Short Feedback Loop. Show the results as soon as you can.

A process takes an input to produce an output. A bunch of processes can be view as a System.

## Systems

A system is anything with multiple parts that depend on each other. In other words, every machine and activity is a system on some level. Systems archieve goals.

Properties to look for in Systems:

* Modular.
  * Loosely coupling. Breaking a chair shouldn't break the dinner!
  * Having multiple parts also allows systems to develop emergent properties. When things interact, they often birth new, unpredictable forms. The sum total of a system is more than its competent parts.
* Responsiveness. Know what the system is doing and make the feedback loop fast.
* Some systems might benefics of being distributed

To [change a system](https://intenseminimalism.com/2015/a-framework-for-thinking-about-systems-change/) you need vision, skills, incentives, resources and an action plan. Changing a [complex system](https://complexityexplained.github.io/) is hard and [even if the intention is good, the result might not](https://fs.blog/2013/10/iatrogenics/). Small things can have non-linear impacts on a complex system. [A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law). Complex systems also have [attractor landscapes](https://ncase.me/attractors/) that can be used to change it. A good approach (similar to natural selection) is to:

  1. Start by identifying the highest-leverage level to optimize at: Ask whether you’re optimizing the machine or a cog within it.
  2. Begin optimizing the system by following the [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints): At any time, just one of a system’s inputs is constraining its other inputs from achieving a greater total output. Make incremental changes.
  3. Re-examine the system from the ground up. Get data. Take nothing but the proven, underlying principles as given. Work up from there to create something better.

A mental model of a system is the reduction of how it works. The model cuts through the noise to highlight the system's core components and how they work together.

### Antifragility

Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures.

It's fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency (ability to recover from failure) and robustness (ability to resist failure).

Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same. The antifragile gets better.

## Incentives

Incentives matter. Everything around you is driven by incentives. There are rarely true "irrational" decisions. If a decision looks irrational to you, it's most likely because you don't truly understand the incentives driving that person.

_"Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior"._ Dee Hock.

To reach a goal, reduce friction or increase incentives/rewards.
