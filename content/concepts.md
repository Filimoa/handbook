## Fallacies

A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning. Logical fallacies are like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often sneakily used by politicians and the media to fool people. They are [tools](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) designed to help us identify and call out dodgy logic wherever it may raise its ugly, incoherent head.

## Mental Models

A mental model is a thought process about how something works in the real world. They can help to shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems (a personal algorithm). The world always makes sense. But it can be confusing. When it is, your model of the world is wrong. Millions of mental models exists, and every discipline has their own set. Some of them overlap and might be called differently.

## Conceptual Compression

From time to time, look for abstractions that can compress the information behind them. This way you can reduce mental space. When needed, you can expand the abstraction and go deeper. This is used a lot in programming, where a new tool or package emerges taking care of that was previously done by human minds (OMRs vs hand written SQL)!

Conceptual compression also allows lazy learning. If you're using the compressed version you don't need to care about what's behind. If you need, you can learn it at that time. Not everything needs to be learned upfront.

## Processes

Whether you're compiling code or making breakfast, everything can be modeled as a repeatable process. Understanding the elements of production — inputs, outputs, timing, limiting steps, quality controls, variability — lets us create and improve the _machinery_ needed to fulfill our goals. We all aim to achieve the same thing: high quality results in less time with least waste.

> If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing. — W. Edwards Deming

You cannot improve what you cannot measure. You cannot improve what you cannot explain. Write down processes, take measures and then iterate.

As [Tobi Lütke points out in the Farnam Streen podcast](https://fs.blog/tobi-lutke/), _there are three kinds of processes_. There's a kind of process that makes things that were previously impossible to do, possible. That's good. Then there's a kind of process that makes something that was previously possible significantly simpler, which is also good. And then there's everything else \(just telling people to behave slightly different from what common sense tells them to do\).

You can [optimize processes](https://youtu.be/lhbLNBqhQkc) through [experiments](https://rs.io/how-to-get-started-with-anything/) and experiences removing barriers or adding tools.

Properties to look for in Processes:

- Algorithmic. So you don't need to think about choices. This reduces mental overhead and anxiety (The Paradox of Choice).
  - A way to reduce choices i self binding (like Ulyses did). Limiting our actions in the future will reduce the choices we'll need to do.
- Flexible. Make if fluid enough to keep up with changes.
- Low Friction. Simple processes are easier to understand and apply.
- Short Feedback Loop. Show the results as soon as you can.

A process takes an input to produce an output. A bunch of processes can be view as a System.

## Systems

A system is anything with multiple parts that depend on each other. In other words, every machine and activity is a system on some level. Systems achieve goals.

Properties to look for in Systems:

- Modular.
  - Loosely coupling. Breaking a chair shouldn't break the dinner!
  - Having multiple parts also allows systems to develop emergent properties. When things interact, they often birth new, unpredictable forms. The sum total of a system is more than its competent parts.
- Responsiveness. Know what the system is doing and make the feedback loop fast.
- Some systems might benefit of being distributed
- Bad Incentive design can lead to the [tragedy of the commons](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/).

To [change a system](https://intenseminimalism.com/2015/a-framework-for-thinking-about-systems-change/) you need vision, skills, incentives, resources and an action plan. Changing a [complex system](https://complexityexplained.github.io/) is hard and [even if the intention is good, the result might not](https://fs.blog/2013/10/iatrogenics/). Small things can have non-linear impacts on a complex system. [A complex system that works is invariably found to have evolved from a simple system that worked](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Gall_(author)#Gall's_law). Complex systems also have [attractor landscapes](https://ncase.me/attractors/) that can be used to change it. A good approach (similar to natural selection) is to:

  1. Start by identifying the highest-leverage level to optimize at: Ask whether you're optimizing the machine or a cog within it.
  2. Begin optimizing the system by following the [Theory of Constraints](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Theory_of_constraints): At any time, just one of a system's inputs is constraining its other inputs from achieving a greater total output. Make incremental changes.
  3. Re-examine the system from the ground up. Get data. Take nothing but the proven, underlying principles as given. Work up from there to create something better.

Some [systems with systemic/incentives failures are broken in multiple places so that no one actor can make them better](https://slatestarcodex.com/2014/07/30/meditations-on-moloch/), even though, in principle, some [magically coordinated action could move to a new stable state](https://equilibriabook.com/molochs-toolbox/).

A mental model of a system is the reduction of how it works. The model cuts through the noise to highlight the system's core components and how they work together.

### Antifragility

Antifragility is a property of systems that increase in capability, resilience, or robustness as a result of stressors, shocks, volatility, noise, mistakes, faults, attacks, or failures.

It's fundamentally different from the concepts of resiliency (ability to recover from failure) and robustness (ability to resist failure).

Antifragility is beyond resilience or robustness. The resilient resists shocks and stays the same. The antifragile gets better.

## Incentives

Incentives matter. Everything around you is driven by incentives. There are rarely true "irrational" decisions. If a decision looks irrational to you, it's most likely because you don't truly understand the incentives driving that person.

_"Simple, clear purpose and principles give rise to complex and intelligent behavior. Complex rules and regulations give rise to simple and stupid behavior"._ Dee Hock.

To reach a goal, reduce friction or increase incentives/rewards.
