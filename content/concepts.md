# Concepts

## Fallacies

A logical fallacy is a flaw in reasoning. Logical fallacies are like tricks or illusions of thought, and they're often sneakily used by politicians and the media to fool people. There's a [cool website](https://yourlogicalfallacyis.com/) designed to help us identify and call out dodgy logic wherever it may raise its ugly, incoherent head.

## Mental Models

A mental model is a thought process about how something works in the real world. They can help to shape behavior and set an approach to solving problems \(a personal algorithm\). Millions of mental models exists, and every discipline has their own set. Some of them overlap and might be called differently.

## Conceptual Compression

From time to time, look for abstractions that can compress the information behind them. This way you can reduce mental space. When needed, you can expand the abstraction and go deeper. This is used a lot in programming, where a new tool or package emerges taking care of that was previously done by human minds \(OMRs vs hand writen SQL\)!

Conceptual compression also allows lazy learning. If you're using the compressed version you don't need to care about what's behind. If you need, you can learn it at that time. Not everything needs to be learned upfront.

## Making Decisions

* Gather all the information you can. Then, schedule time to think deeply about it. Remember that too much information increases confidence not accuracy.
* If all options are similar take the harder one in the short term \(_Hard decisions easy life, easy decisions, hard life_\).
* Look for win-win decisions. If someone has to lose, you’re not thinking hard enough or you need to make structural/environmental changes.
* The rule of 5. Think about what the decision looks like 5 days, 5 weeks, 5 months, 5 years, 5 decades.
* Ask what information would cause you to change your mind. If you don’t have that information, find it. If you do, track is religiously. Collect feedback and be open to change outcomes.
* How un-doable is a decision? If an idea is fully un-doable, make it as quickly as you can. When a decision is something that you can’t take back, then it’s worth really, really understanding.

## [Problem Solving](http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/culture-is-a-shared-mechanism-for-problem-solving/)

* The first group of people that encounter a problem don't know how to solve it.
* They figure out a way of doing it, and when they get to a solution that's good enough \(not perfect, just good enough\), that's what they settle on.
* The next time they encounter the problem, they use the same solution.
* That keeps happening until later people don't even think about how to do it. [It's just how things are done](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Einstellung_effect).

## Processes

Whether you’re compiling code or making breakfast, everything can be modeled as a repeatable process. Understanding the elements of production — inputs, outputs, timing, limiting steps, quality controls, variability — lets us create and improve the _machinery_ needed to fulfill our goals. We all aim to achieve the same thing: high quality results in less time with least waste.

> If you can't describe what you are doing as a process, you don't know what you're doing. — W. Edwards Deming

Write down processes and iterate over them. You cannot improve what you cannot explain.

As [Tobi Lütke points out in the Farnam Streen podcast](https://fs.blog/tobi-lutke/), _there are three kinds of processes_. There’s a kind of process that makes things that were previously impossible to do, possible. That’s good. Then there’s a kind of process that makes something that was previously possible significantly simpler, which is also good. And then there’s everything else \(just telling people to behave slightly different from what common sense tells them to do\)

You can [optimize processes](https://youtu.be/lhbLNBqhQkc) through experiments and experiences removing barriers or adding tools.
