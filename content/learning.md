# Learning

- Understand the base and build from it. First Principles Method.
- You can apply [The Feynman Technique][feynman]:
  1.  Identify the subject.
  2.  Teach it to a child. Use simple vocabulary and make it short.
  3.  Identify your knowledge gaps. What are you missing?
  4.  Organize and Simplify. Tell a story to teach. Analogies help here!
- Follow the guidelines stated in Coursera's [_Learning How to Learn_ summary][lhtl].
- Write down the process that better worked for you.
- Keep improving the processes with the learning of failed experiences.
- [Learn iterating over the process][naval].
- Everything is always subject to change (including this handbook).
- Learn to ask better questions. Distill what you know to figure out what part you're missing or which link is missing.
- There are two modes of thinking:
  - Focused: When you're actively trying to learn something.
  - Diffuse: Relaxed thinking style that connects your learning while you're doing other tasks (playing, sleeping, doing exercise, ...).
- Reading is a meta-skill. Learn to read and understand so you can trade time reading for some skills.
- Experience ideas directly. Use the [ADEPT][adept] method as a checklist for what helps a concept click:
  - Have an Analogy about it.
  - Visualize it in a Diagram.
  - Gather Examples.
  - Come with a Plain-English description of the concept.
  - The give into the Technical side.
- When discovering a pattern, try to abstract it as much as you can instead of applying it only to a certain area. Once you made this abstraction you will have a new [mental model](../concepts).
- Learning to program shapes the mind the same way a new language does. Each learning help modelling the world.

## [Capture, Organize, Synthesize](http://gordonbrander.com/pattern/capture-organize-synthesize/)

- Capture as much as possible. Your thoughts are more valuable than paper. Externalize what you learn. Once an idea is captured in a tangible form you can begin surveying and manipulating it.
- Organize only after you capture. Filter, but don't delete irrelevant information. Computers are big enough to search and store everything. Make them manage it.
- Synthesize into new meaning. Re-contextualize what you learn. This is the creative act. Experience becomes art, notes become a novel.
