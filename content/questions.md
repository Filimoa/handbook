# Open Questions

Some questions which are not necessarily important, but I'm intrigued about and haven't researched enough to add their own entry on this handbook. Inspired by [Gwern Questions](https://www.gwern.net/Questions), [Patrick Collison](https://patrickcollison.com/questions) and [Alexey Guzey](https://guzey.com/personal/research-ideas/).
