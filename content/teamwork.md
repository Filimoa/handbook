# Teamwork

* Share a vision to make [loosely coupled, tightly aligned teams](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/).
* When coming up with a long-term technical vision is important to stay abstract.
  * Stick to defining components and keep concepts. Show how the components interact.
  * Define boundaries and limitations of each component.
  * Write tech specs before you write software \(examples in [Codeburst](https://codeburst.io/on-writing-tech-specs-6404c9791159) and [Lyft](https://eng.lyft.com/awesome-tech-specs-86eea8e45bb9)\). A tech spec forces you to think through complicated issues and to get everyone on the same page. This helps to avoid wasting time on dead-end solutions or building the wrong thing.
* Define the culture and values. [Culture](https://github.com/bjeanes/culture/blob/master/culture_and_ethos.md) is simply a shared way of doing something with passion. Culture is created and re-created by the choices made by individuals every day. It can be reshaped by conscious effort applied gently, subtly, and consistently.
  * Make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do.
  * Solve problems by fixing the environment that allowed them to occur.
  * Times change, trends change, cultures change.
* Work in the open and document everything.
  * Processes
  * Conventions
  * Meetings
    * Update meetings
      * Progress: what did I accomplish this week?
      * Plans: What tasks am I doing next week?
      * Problems: what is blocking progress?
      * Other: what else should the team know?
    * Decision meetings
      * Progress on achieving current quarterly objectives
      * How the product is being received in the market
      * How the most important customers are succeeding (or not) using the product
      * How the team is performing and any people changes needed
      * Financial position of the company and review of metrics
  * Responsibilities
* You can create a Handbook to put everything together. Everyone should contribute to it and each page has a clear owner that aim to keep it consistent with the rest of the Handbook.
* Keep a source of truth and keep it up to date. When something is not relevant anymore, deprecate or delete it. All the documents should evolve.
* Aim to be a completely autonomous team. You build it, you run it!
* Someone should be the information hub. It helps connecting the dots that wouldn’t otherwise get connected.
* Write postmortems after large incidents. This will create a feedback loop to guide learning about what happened and how it can be avoided next time.
* Don't focus on a particular solution to a problem, instead, describe the problem itself. Always provide the full context of what you’re trying to do when requesting help.
* How to drive change: find people who agree on the problem, start small, experiment, scale, repeat.
* [Brainstorm for questions first. Then find the answers.](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/better-brainstorming)
* Every business has an equation that describes how it generates revenue. Write it down and decompose it to better understand the relationships.
* Strive for constructive conflict. Get people to ask questions. Engage in passionate, unfiltered debate about what you need to do to succeed.
* Encourage to fail. Failing is good if the team learn from it!
* Push relentlessly toward automation.
  * Investigate where \(and how\) processes and tasks could be automated, and understanding the costs of automating them.
* A company may be looked as a combination of 3 things:
  * The people who work at the company.
  * The process the company uses to get work done.
  * The purpose for which the company exists.

## Communication

* Use [common techniques](https://github.com/davidgasquez/handbook/tree/7b0e2ab97c202895a0971a9c7eb6c0516af3a646/content/communications/README.md) and always be friendly.
* Prefer asynchronous communications.
* Have a primary communication channel.
* Agree on the terminology. Similar understanding of terms makes discussion more productive.
* Work through confrontations mindfully:
  * Acknowledge the positive intentions. Try to understanding his or her rationale and state it out loud directly to them.
  * Express what you see!
  * Identify and propose a solution. You should try to build consensus by demonstrating how your solution will resolve everyone’s concerns, not just your own.
  * Outline the benefits and advantages of your proposal.
  * Understanding. Either nail down agreement on a next action or step, or work together to develop alternatives
