# Teamwork

* Share a vision to make [loosely coupled, tightly aligned teams](https://labs.spotify.com/2014/03/27/spotify-engineering-culture-part-1/).
* When coming up with a long-term technical vision is important to stay abstract.
  * Stick to defining components and keep concepts. Show how the components interact.
  * Define boundaries and limitations of each component.
  * Write tech specs before you write software \(examples in [Codeburst](https://codeburst.io/on-writing-tech-specs-6404c9791159) and [Lyft](https://eng.lyft.com/awesome-tech-specs-86eea8e45bb9)\). A tech spec forces you to think through complicated issues and to get everyone on the same page. This helps to avoid wasting time on dead-end solutions or building the wrong thing.
* Define the culture and values. [Culture](https://github.com/bjeanes/culture/blob/master/culture_and_ethos.md) is simply a shared way of doing something with passion. Culture is created and re-created by the choices made by individuals every day. It can be reshaped by conscious effort applied gently, subtly, and consistently.
  * Make the right thing to do the easiest thing to do.
  * Solve problems by fixing the environment that allowed them to occur.
  * Times change, trends change, cultures change.
* Work in the open and document everything.
  * Processes
    * Write status updates
  * Conventions
    * Confirm decisions to move them forward
    * Offer conclusions in long discussions
  * Meetings
    * Update meetings
      * Progress: what did I accomplish this week?
      * Plans: What tasks am I doing next week?
      * Problems: what is blocking progress?
      * Other: what else should the team know?
    * Decision meetings
      * Progress on achieving current quarterly objectives
      * How the product is being received in the market
      * How the most important customers are succeeding (or not) using the product
      * How the team is performing and any people changes needed
      * Financial position of the company and review of metrics
  * Responsibilities
* You can create a Handbook to put everything together. Everyone should contribute to it and each page has a clear owner that aim to keep it consistent with the rest of the Handbook.
* Keep a source of truth and keep it up to date. When something is not relevant anymore, deprecate or delete it. All the documents should evolve.
* Aim to be a completely autonomous team. You build it, you run it!
* Build a culture of stopping to fix problems, to get quality right the first time.
* Standardized tasks and processes are the foundation for continuous improvement and employee empowerment.
* Someone should be the information hub. It helps connecting the dots that wouldn’t otherwise get connected.
* Write postmortems after large incidents. This will create a feedback loop to guide learning about what happened and how it can be avoided next time.
* Don't focus on a particular solution to a problem, instead, describe the problem itself. Always provide the full context of what you’re trying to do when requesting help.
* How to drive change: find people who agree on the problem, start small, experiment, scale, repeat.
* [Brainstorm for questions first. Then find the answers.](https://getpocket.com/explore/item/better-brainstorming)
* Every business has an equation that describes how it generates revenue. Write it down and decompose it to better understand the relationships.
* Strive for constructive conflict. Get people to ask questions. Engage in passionate, unfiltered debate about what you need to do to succeed.
* Encourage to fail. Failing is good if the team learn from it!
* Push relentlessly toward automation.
  * Investigate where \(and how\) processes and tasks could be automated, and understanding the costs of automating them.
* A company may be looked as a combination of 3 things:
  * The people who work at the company.
  * The process the company uses to get work done.
  * The purpose for which the company exists.

## Engineering Process

1. Always create an issue and assign it to you for anything you work on. If it is worth spending time on, it is worth creating an issue for it since that enables other people to learn and help. You can always edit the description or close it when the problem is something different or disappears.
2. When working on an issue, make sure that the issue body contains the latest information. The issue body should be the single source of truth.
3. After a discussion related to an issue update the issue body with the consensus or final conclusions. This makes it much easier to see the current state of an issue for everyone involved in the implementation and prevents confusion later on.
4. Submit the smallest item of work that makes sense. When creating an issue describe the smallest fix possible, put suggestions for enhancements in separate issues and link them.
5. Do not leave issues open for a long time, issues should be actionable and realistic. If an issue has been addressed or is not relevant anymore, close it. If someone disagrees, they can re-open it and explain what is still relevant.
6. If you complete part of an issue and need someone else to take the next step, re-assign the issue to that person.
7. When working on an issue, ask for feedback from your peers. Try to get a [review](https://github.com/thoughtbot/guides/tree/master/code-review) of your work. Even a quick look could do it. If they suggest changes, you get the opportunity to improve. This promotes collaboration and advances everyone's skills.

## Communication

* Use [common techniques](https://github.com/davidgasquez/handbook/blob/master/content/communications.md) and be friendly.
* Prefer asynchronous communications.
* Have a primary communication channel.
* Agree on the terminology. Similar understanding of terms makes discussion more productive.
* Work through confrontations mindfully:
  * Acknowledge the positive intentions. Try to understanding his or her rationale and state it out loud directly to them.
  * Express what you see!
  * Identify and propose a solution. You should try to build consensus by demonstrating how your solution will resolve everyone’s concerns, not just your own.
  * Outline the benefits and advantages of your proposal.
  * Understanding. Either nail down agreement on a next action or step, or work together to develop alternatives.
