# Communications

> To effectively communicate, we must realize that we are all different in the way we perceive the world and use this understanding as a guide to our communication with others — Tony Robbins

Communication is the science of transmitting knowledge to other humans. It goes by many names: debate, negotiation, discussion, education, and many more. Communication is a skill that is learnable.

**The person who tells the most compelling story wins**. Not the best idea. Just the story that catches people's attention and gets them to nod their heads. Tell people what they want to hear and you can be wrong indefinitely without penalty.

## Feedback

Feedback is the core of personal and professional growth. Feedback help us being better at what we do establishing clear communications and expectations.

All feedback is good feedback. If you agree with it, it tells you something about yourself which you can to work on correcting. If you don't agree with it, it tells you that there is an incorrect perception about you in the other persons mind. You can also work on correcting that. When someone tells you something is wrong, they're almost always right. When someone tells you how to fix it, they're almost always wrong. Collect feedback from everybody.

### Taking Feedback

- Use the word advice instead of feedback to get more results.
- The only constant in the world is change. Be open to it and accept it with a smile.
- Understand and accept that you will make mistakes.
- Be mindful. Develop meta-awareness around the areas that you received feedback.
  - Look for opportunities to _stop doing_ or _start doing_ critiqued behaviors.

#### Technical Feedback

- You are not your work (code, design, ...).
- No matter how much you know about something, someone else will always know more.
- Treat people who know less than you with respect, deference, and patience.
- True authority stems from knowledge, not from position.
- Critique code instead of people — be kind to the coder, not to the code.
- Focus on [Empathy](http://bravenewgeek.com/engineering-empathy/).

### Giving Feedback

- Feedback needs to be informal, frequent, and done authentically.
- Challenge ideas not people. Address behavior, but don't label people.
- Prepare. What do you value in someone? Where do you think are their biggest opportunities to improve?
- Keep the feedback actionable, specific, and kind.
- Imagine what things feel like from the other perspective.
- How to compose a successful critical commentary (_from_ [_Daniel Dennett_](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Daniel_Dennett)):
  - You should attempt to re-express your target's position so clearly, vividly, and fairly that your target says, _"Thanks, I wish I'd thought of putting it that way"_.
  - You should list any points of agreement (if they are not matters of general or widespread agreement).
  - You should mention anything you have learned from your target.
  - Only then are you permitted to say so much as a word of rebuttal or criticism.

## Resolving Disagreement

We should be arguing in a constructive fashion: treating arguments as an opportunity to expand knowledge, finding points of disagreement, and collaborating towards a common truth. A few assumptions are required to have a successfully disagreement:

- Epistemic humility. "It's possible that I might be the one who's wrong, here".
- Arguments are not soldiers. Most people go into debate with a war-like mentality, they feel they must fly the flag for all points that their side supports, regardless of how much they actually agree with them.
  - Do not be afraid to agree with the arguments of the other side when they strike you as reasonable, and critique the arguments of your own side when they strike you as unreasonable.
- Good faith. An assumption that people believe things for causal reasons. Assume good intentions.
- Confidence in the existence of objective truth or a better position.
- Curiosity and/or a desire to uncover truth.
- As much data as possible to backup claims. Cognitive biases are limits and mistakes in human judgement that prevent someone from acting rationally. They are present in every aspect of human life, and in tense situations like arguments, they tend to appear more often as emotions are heightened and the brain gets overloaded.

[Specific strategies we can employ to make sure a debate stays as constructive as possible](http://www.liamrosen.com/arguments.html):
  - Let your opponent know exactly how strongly you feel about a certain argument.
  - Find the crux, the point where you and your opponent's argument intersect.
  - Restate someone's point back to them to make sure you understood it correctly. This is called echoing and is more necessary for synchronous debates where information flows quickly. Not only does this make them feel heard, it also allows them the chance to clarify their beliefs.
  - Leave your partner a line of retreat.
  - Instead of taking on a weaker version of your opponent's argument, help the entire debate out by thinking of the best and most charitable version of your opponent's argument, then repeat it back to them to see if it makes sense.

#### [Nonviolent Communication](https://www.clearerthinking.org/post/2019/03/06/want-to-improve-your-relationships-try-nonviolent-communication-1)

Nonviolent communication (NVC) is a popular method of conflict resolution that privileges unbiased evidence and specificity. It is also a tool for thinking that may help improve the way you communicate, whether it be with family, friends, colleagues. The Four Steps of NVC:

1. Observe Facts - observe the specific facts that are affecting our wellbeing, and bring them up with the other person.
2. Note Feelings - introspect about what exactly we are feeling in response to what we've observed, and communicate these feelings.
3. Uncover Desires - figure out the desires, wants and values that are creating our feelings, and explain them to the other person.
4. Make Requests - ask for concrete actions to help resolve the situation.

### [Double crux]((https://www.lesswrong.com/posts/exa5kmvopeRyfJgCy/double-crux-a-strategy-for-resolving-disagreement))

Double crux is great framework based on the previous assumptions, were both parties abstract their arguments by one level and find a falsifiable fact that, if proven true, would cause them to change their beliefs.

- Focus on narrowing the scope of the discussion. Find common ground.
- Define terms to avoid getting lost in semantic confusions that miss the real point.
- Ask "What would need to be true for you to change your mind?".
- Find specific test cases.

Don't focus on proving yourself right, instead of focus on getting the best outcome.
Keep the conversation simple and summarize the conversation during the discussion.
