# Writing

- Try to use the active voice whenever possible.
- Keep in mind your style:
  - **Be concise**. Understand the topic you're writing about. Use simple words and sentences. Put the most important things first. Never use a long word when a short one will do.
  - **Be Useful**. Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
  - **Be specific**. Avoid vague language (remove qualifiers). Cut the fluff. Delete unnecessary words. Say what you mean. Make positive statements about reality.
  - **Be consistent**.
  - **Add rhythm**. Vary the sentence length to break the monotony.
- [Style is a small part of writing well. Most of writing is thinking clearly.](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) The act of simply putting a thought into words makes it immediately obvious to you if you really understand it or not, and if not, where your blind spots are.
- Have solid schemas. List the points you want to make in a logical order. This allows you to remove the clutter and avoid confusion:
  - Define a clear thesis.
  - Support your thesis with arguments.
  - Declare and reject the antithesis.
  - Conclusions.
- Human beings are wired to respond to storytelling. A story arc is a way to structure ideas to tap into this response, typically by describing a change in the world.
- Use positive language rather than negative language.
- Write in a conversational tone.
- Use second-person and describe actions to a user. Technical content talks to users when support agents can't.
- [Divide things into small chunks and if you have multiple points in a text, number them to make replies easier](https://slatestarcodex.com/2016/02/20/writing-advice/).
- Don't fully think through your ideas before writing. It's inefficient. The best way to think is by writing. It compels your brain to connect the dots. [Write whatever helps you think better](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1256828197410201601). Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can't write and edit.
- You can use tools like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) or [Ludwig](https://ludwig.guru/) to improve.

### Blogging

- Writing is Thinking. Writing things down helps clarifying ideas. One of the tests of whether you understand something is whether you can explain it to someone else. [Writing doesn't just communicate ideas; it generates them](http://www.paulgraham.com/writing44.html).
- Expect 80% of the ideas in an post to happen after you start writing it, and 50% of those you start with to be wrong.
- To decide if your idea is worth writing about, [ask these questions](https://jvns.ca/blog/2016/05/22/how-do-you-write-blog-posts/):
  - Would this have helped me a year ago?
  - Would this have helped me last week?
  - Do you think this would be interesting to at least like 2 other people?
- [You are best positioned to help people one step behind you](https://medium.com/@racheltho/why-you-yes-you-should-blog-7d2544ac1045). The material is still fresh in your mind. Many experts have forgotten what it was like to be a beginner and have forgotten why the topic is hard to understand when you first hear it. The context of your particular background, your particular style, and your knowledge level will give a different twist to what you're writing about.
- [Share unoriginal ideas](https://guzey.com/personal/why-have-a-blog/). Your own ideas mostly seem trivial to you because you have the right concept structures in place to support them. You wouldn't come up with these ideas otherwise.
- Start with Why. Start with a question. Write the first flawed answer that comes to mind. Write the first question or objection that comes to mind from that answer. Write the first response that comes to mind from that, ...
- [Writing creates a cache](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1256828203840073728). The cache (i.e., documents) scales data availability. people can access the cache instead of going to you.
- For long-form content, the [diamond model](https://dropbox.design/article/mental-models-for-designers) works great for putting a structure around your main idea.
  1. Attention: Start with a story, statistic, or something similar
  1. Main topic: Briefly introduce the main topic you'll cover
  1. Previews: Give quick previews of your subtopics
  1. Subtopics: Go into depth with your subtopics
  1. Summaries: Recap your subtopics
  1. Conclusion: Paint an ideal vision of the future
  1. Call to action: Invite your audience to act or make a decision
- For [short-form content](https://sivers.org/7):
  1. Write all your thoughts on a subject.
  1. Argue against those ideas.
  1. Explore different angles.
  1. Leave it for a few days or years, then repeat those steps.
  1. Hate how messy these thoughts have become.
  1. Reduce them to a tiny outline of the key points.
  1. Post the outline. Trash the rest.
- Reading is the inhale, writing is the exhale. Breathe.
- The more you create, the more ideas come yo you to continue creating. That's the creativity feedback loop.
