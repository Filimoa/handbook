# Writing

- Try to use the active voice whenever possible.
- Keep in mind your style:
  - **Be concise**. Understand the topic you're writing about. Use simple words and sentences. Put the most important things first. Never use a long word when a short one will do.
  - **Be Useful**. Before you start writing, ask yourself: What purpose does this serve? Who is going to read it? What do they need to know?
  - **Be specific**. Avoid vague language (remove qualifiers). Cut the fluff. Delete unnecessary words. Say what you mean. Make positive statements about reality.
  - **Be consistent**.
  - **Add rhythm**. Vary the sentence length to break the monotony.
- [Style is a small part of writing well. Most of writing is thinking clearly.](https://www.julian.com/guide/write/intro) The act of simply putting a thought into words makes it immediately obvious to you if you really understand it or not, and if not, where your blind spots are.
- Have solid schemas. List the points you want to make in a logical order. This allows you to remove the clutter and avoid confusion:
  - Define a clear thesis.
  - Support your thesis with arguments.
  - Declare and reject the antithesis.
  - Conclusions.
- Human beings are wired to respond to storytelling. A story arc is a way to structure ideas to tap into this response, typically by describing a change in the world.
- Use positive language rather than negative language.
- Write in a conversational tone.
- Use second-person and describe actions to a user. Technical content talks to users when support agents can't.
- Divide things into small chunks.
- If you have multiple points in a text, number them to make replies easier.
- Don't fully think through your ideas before writing. It's inefficient. The best way to think is by writing. It compels your brain to connect the dots. [Write whatever helps you think better](https://twitter.com/eugeneyan/status/1256828197410201601). Separate the processes of creation from improving. You can't write and edit.
- You can use tools like [Hemingway](http://www.hemingwayapp.com/) or [Ludwig](https://ludwig.guru/) to improve.

## [Presentation Rules](http://www.jilles.net/perma/2020/06/05/presentation-rules.html)

- Don't expose one bullet point of a list at a time. Your audience will ask to go back a slide or two, you end up half way in a build, or worse, with an empty slide. None of this is needed.
- Use fewer words. There is a place for details and context, but the most important is the actual message you want to get across.
- Have a summary.
- Structure. Stories can be told in many different ways. One way that works well in most situations is to divide the story arc up in Situation, Complication and Solution. Leaving one of these three components out will seriously hamper your ability to convince your audience, just like it is hard to ascend a staircase with stairs missing.
- Number the slides.
- Don't present any slide with a wall of text.
- Titles for the graphs should be the conclusion.
