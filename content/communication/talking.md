# Talking

- Smile and look at the eyes.
- Remove filler words.
- Speak with sincerity and passion.
- Speak [slow](https://sive.rs/slow) and naturally.
  - Your first reaction is usually outdated. Either it's an answer you came up with long ago and now use instead of thinking, or it's a knee-jerk emotional response to something in your past.
- Learn to **listen**.
  - Become interested in other people. Encourage others to talk about themselves. The more you are interested in others, the more interesting they find you. To be interesting, be interested.
  - Being able to listen well is a superpower. Listening is difficult because it involves suppressing your ego long enough to consider what is being said before you respond.
  - Forget your agenda. Don't have internal monologue.
  - Avoid trying to respond immediately and allow the other person time to finish speaking.
  - Don't answer your phone while speaking with someone in real life. If the real life conversation starts, has precedence over the asynchronous ones.
  - While listening to someone sharing a problem keep asking them "Is there more?", until there is no more.
  - Connect with people, don't perform for them.
- Aim to make liberal use of the _you_ pronoun.
- No matter how correct you are, you won't get anywhere by making the other person feel stupid. Not being annoying is more important than being smart. Aim to make friends. [Friends are better than money. Almost anything money can do, friends can do better. In so many ways a friend with a boat is better than owning a boat](https://kk.org/thetechnium/68-bits-of-unsolicited-advice/).
- Ask for help instead of demanding it.
- Favor interrogative-led questions over leading questions. A leading question attempts to get the listener to agree or disagree with a premise you feed to them. An interrogative-led question often begins with the words: who; where; what; when; why. "Did you like the movie?" vs "What did you think about the movie?".
- Make [interesting questions](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1K_iFxFt9lh1i0mxKRIhOSd2e8X1LNvxnihbChKXhyOc/mobilebasic) to know people better. Use FORD (Family, Occupation, Recreation, Dreams) as fallback topics.
- Remember people's names. Humans want to be significant. We strive for meaning.
- Dishonest Flattery while effective in some cases, will destroy you long term. If you are unable to find a compliment about another human being that is truthful, you're not trying hard enough.

## [Presentation Rules](http://www.jilles.net/perma/2020/06/05/presentation-rules.html)

- Don't expose one bullet point of a list at a time. Your audience will ask to go back a slide or two, you end up half way in a build, or worse, with an empty slide. None of this is needed.
- Use fewer words. There is a place for details and context, but the most important is the actual message you want to get across.
- Have a summary.
- Structure. Stories can be told in many different ways. One way that works well in most situations is to divide the story arc up in Situation, Complication and Solution. Leaving one of these three components out will seriously hamper your ability to convince your audience, just like it is hard to ascend a staircase with stairs missing.
- Number the slides.
- Don't present any slide with a wall of text.
- Titles for the graphs should be the conclusion.
