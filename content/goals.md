# Goals

This section contains my current goals. These are changing from time to time although they're focused on my mission, **"Enjoy and learn"**. It's important for me to find where my next improvement will come from. Life is just a series of these steps that push you forward, little by little, but it [compounds][c-i]. And remember, there are [no hacks][hacks] in life!
